&lt;h2 id=&#34;without-actually-doing-that&#34;&gt;…without actually doing that&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-got-here&#34;&gt;How we got here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Apple released its (soon-to-be) previous generation Mac Pro, it probably didn&#39;t take long for them to realize they had a trash can fire on their hands, especially with &lt;a href=&#34;https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening&#34;&gt;regards to GPU performance&lt;/a&gt;. When Apple announced eGPU support for macOS in 2017&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20170731114535/https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra-preview/&#34;&gt;High Sierra release&lt;/a&gt;, it was hard not to see the announcement as anything more than an admission that Apple&#39;s top-of-the-line desktops and notebooks shipped with subpar GPUs due to their severe thermal constraints. Of course,  because Apple has never considered AAA gaming to be an important function of its products, the Mac has always lagged behind Windows in GPU availability and support. But by 2017 (and until the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imore.com/mac-pro-2019-everything-you-need-know&#34;&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; tower releases this fall), the situation has been especially grim: even for workstation tasks like video encoding and 3D modeling, the internal GPUs Apple has been selling are so bad that they&#39;re driving a nontrivial number of creative professionals—a market Apple actually does care about—off its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world may be excited to close the door on the ill-conceived trash can Mac Pro, but if it hadn&#39;t been for its glaring design flaws, Apple and Intel probably wouldn&#39;t have prioritized the engineering needed to make running an eGPU over Thunderbolt 3 a commercial reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&#39;s thanks to the trash can Mac Pro that in 2019, it can truthfully be said: instead of putting a beefy graphics card &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; your computer, &lt;strong&gt;you are now able to take a top-of-the-line gaming GPU, seat it inside an external box, plug that box into your computer, and—using a single high-bandwidth cable—push the necessary instructions to render 4K games at 60 frames per second on the card before (over the very same cable!) pushing those frames back to your notebook&#39;s built-in monitor without introducing any perceptible latency&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;ve seen daily evidence of this for the last month and I gotta say: it&#39;s pretty freakin&#39; cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that you&#39;d be able to connect a GPU over a 2-meter cable and get desktop-class gaming performance out of the current crop of MacBooks Pro seems far-fetched. Even to me, as I literally play games with one. When reasonable people encounter Apple&#39;s marketing about eGPUs—which is only focused on creative professional workflows like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S48T-cOG0ks&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;modeling&lt;/em&gt; VR experiences as opposed to &lt;em&gt;experiencing&lt;/em&gt; them&lt;/a&gt;—it would be unreasonable to make the logical leap to say, &amp;quot;ah, yes, surely if I boot that computer into Windows, the eGPU enclosure would have the necessary drivers and the Thunderbolt 3 cable would have the necessary bandwidth to render games in real-time with an acceptable frame rate and input latency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yet&lt;/em&gt;, AAA PC gaming is actually within reach of a recent MacBook Pro paired with an eGPU. It&#39;s just that nobody &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-core-x&#34;&gt;other than Razer&lt;/a&gt; is telling the market that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-get-started&#34;&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pieced this all together from dozens of forum posts, guides, and build data from the small-but-dedicated community at &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io&#34;&gt;eGPU.io&lt;/a&gt;. Because the very-newest Macs, eGPU enclosures, and operating system releases have made things much easier as of late, much of the content in the most popular guides is no longer relevant. Therefore, I will try to document here a stripped-down walkthrough that starts fresh with the latest operating systems and hardware components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.4-quad-core-13-mid-2019-touch-bar-specs.html&#34;&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro (mid-2019)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-vii&#34;&gt;AMD Radeon VII&lt;/a&gt; card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Core-V2-Thunderbolt-Enclosure/dp/B0791ZCH4Q&#34;&gt;Razer Core V2&lt;/a&gt; (which Razer has already discontinued in favor of the larger, cheaper &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-core-x&#34;&gt;Razer Core X&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any certified &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H5QF2TK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;2 meter Thunderbolt 3 cable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any TV or external monitor you want to output games to (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macOS 10.14.5 (18F132)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 version 1903 (18362.175)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-questions-you-might-have&#34;&gt;Initial questions you might have&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about my 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro?&lt;/strong&gt; The 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro may be beefier, but it&#39;s
actually more of a pain to set up for this purpose, because convincing Windows
to yield to the eGPU instead of the discrete AMD GPU that the 15&amp;quot; model ships
with takes a bit of work. Most of this guide will suit you fine, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/forums/mac-setup/how-to-keep-mbps-irisiris-pro-activated-when-booting-into-windows-boot-camp/&#34;&gt;this
thread&lt;/a&gt;
might provide some guidance beyond what I offer here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why an AMD card over Nvidia?&lt;/strong&gt; If you plan on ever plugging the eGPU into macOS (as opposed to Windows), you&#39;re going to have a much easier time of it with an AMD card. macOS ships with drivers for most AMD cards, but Nvidia support is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/forums/mac-setup/wip-nvidia-egpu-support-for-high-sierra/&#34;&gt;tremendous pain&lt;/a&gt; that&#39;s only getting worse with time, as zero Mac drivers are available for their new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/&#34;&gt;RTX&lt;/a&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a Razer Core V2?&lt;/strong&gt; I chose this model because it&#39;s lightweight (at a &amp;quot;mere&amp;quot; 11 pounds), properly isolates bandwidth (5gbps) for its 4 USB ports, and is relatively small (7.5 liter). It can&#39;t help much with heat or noise, though. In truth, there are actually quite a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/external-gpu-buyers-guide-2019/&#34;&gt;decent options out there&lt;/a&gt;, and most will incorporate the same Thunderbolt 3 controller doing the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why an external monitor?&lt;/strong&gt; While both macOS and Windows can &amp;quot;loopback&amp;quot; frames rendered by the eGPU over the cable and onto the computer&#39;s built-in monitor, operating system support for this is very recent and it introduces a nonzero bandwidth cost which can result in lower framerates as well as frames being dropped. Adding to that, the relatively high DPI of Apple&#39;s displays makes running games at native resolutions more demanding than monitors designed for PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about my pre-2019 MacBook Pro?&lt;/strong&gt; If your Mac has Thunderbolt 3 ports (&lt;a href=&#34;https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.0-13-late-2016-retina-display-no-touch-bar-specs.html&#34;&gt;late-2016&lt;/a&gt; or later), you&#39;ll be able to figure out a way to make it work, but with an increased amount of Windows futzing for each year you go back. I initially set all this up with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.3-13-mid-2017-retina-display-no-touch-bar-specs.html&#34;&gt;mid-2017&lt;/a&gt; MacBook Pro, but wound up spending six or seven hours applying various salves and incantations to try to work around &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/2016-macbook-pro-solving-egpu-error-12-in-windows-10/&#34;&gt;Windows Error 12&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, which is the nonsense Device Manager will spew when Windows can&#39;t figure out how to get sufficient bandwidth and memory addressed to the eGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, with that out of the way. Let&#39;s see what it looks like to set this all up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-by-step-instructions&#34;&gt;Step-by-step instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of being too verbose, I&#39;ve decided to document literally every little step of the process I took in setting things up, because even minor gaps I found in other people&#39;s builds online would often mask tremendous complexities that took me hours to figure out on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembling-the-egpu&#34;&gt;Assembling the eGPU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by unboxing your GPU and eGPU enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&#39;s a Radeon VII card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_4111.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Radeon VII card&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s a Razer Core V2 eGPU enclosure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_4113.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A Razer Core V2 eGPU enclosure&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Razer&#39;s eGPU models have a simple handle locking mechanism that makes it easy to get at the PCI slot and release or mount a card. Mounting a card is pretty simple: just remove the I/O plate facade, push the card&#39;s pins into the slot, and connect the enclosure&#39;s two ATX power connectors into the top of the card. It&#39;ll look like this before you slide it back into place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_4112.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A Radeon VII card seated inside the PCI slot of a Razer Core V2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you opt for the cheaper, quieter, larger Razer Core X, here&#39;s an idea of the size difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_4114.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a large Razer Core X and a small Razer Core V2 sitting side by side&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, here&#39;s what it all looks like when thrown onto a desk with a monitor and a keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_4122.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;monitor, keyboard, mouse, eGPU, and closed MacBook Pro&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eGPU ships with a hilariously short 1-foot cable, so you&#39;ll want to reach for an active 2 meter cable as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-macos&#34;&gt;Setting up macOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one&#39;s easy: update macOS to the current release version, which (as of this writing) is 10.14.5. If you&#39;re on that version or newer, just plug the eGPU enclosure into a power outlet, then connect it to the computer via a Thunderbolt 3 cable, and you should immediately see it recognized in the &amp;quot;About This Mac&amp;quot; view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-12 at 9.55.41 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;macOS About This System dialog, showing version 10.14.5&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s it. On macOS, this is all truly plug-and-play. If you have any games that run on macOS, they should be able to immediately take advantage of the eGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have certain apps that need an extra push to use that GPU, you can tell macOS to present only that GPU to them by checking &amp;quot;Prefer external GPU&amp;quot; in the application&#39;s &amp;quot;Get Info&amp;quot; dialog in Finder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-30 at 9.40.00 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dialog for &amp;quot;Prefer External GPU&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while you can &amp;quot;hot plug&amp;quot; an eGPU into your machine at any time while running the computer, I think it&#39;d be more fair to say you can merely &amp;quot;warm unplug&amp;quot; it. You&#39;re first supposed to tell macOS to force restart any apps that are currently depending on the eGPU via this menu bar option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-30 at 9.44.18 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Menubar option to disconnect eGPU&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fail to do this and yank the cable without first unmounting the eGPU, macOS will yell at you (before proceeding to force-restart most of the apps you were just running):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-30 at 9.48.27 AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;macOS warning not to unplug the eGPU without unmounting it first&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s pretty much all there is to using an eGPU with macOS. The entire experience is so invisible and seamless that Apple&#39;s engineers deserve to be commended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-windows-via-boot-camp&#34;&gt;Installing Windows via Boot Camp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you do anything else, disconnect your eGPU.&lt;/strong&gt; When it&#39;s safe to plug it in under Windows, I&#39;ll let you know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process hasn&#39;t changed much in the last 12 years. Start by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&#34;&gt;downloading Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of mid-June 2019, the most recent downloadable version of the Windows 10 installer was the October 2018 release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-14 at 7.25.16 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 10 download dialog&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once downloaded, launch Boot Camp Assistant, which will download some support software, ask for the Windows disk image (which, if the download is complete, it may detect automatically), and prompt you to choose your partition size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-14 at 7.49.01 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Boot Camp assistant setup page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boot Camp Assistant is still finicky and on AFPS volumes will regularly report failure when attempting to partition the disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Screen Shot 2019-06-14 at 8.25.33 PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;boot camp partition failure&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happens, just quit the app, reboot, and try again. It has never not taken me at least two tries. Once it&#39;s working, you should be booted into the Windows installer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Image-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important step is actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; entering your product key (which can be done later), but ensuring you pick the edition of Windows for which you have (or want) a license. In my case, Windows 10 Pro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Image 2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Windows Installer edition selection page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing to look out for is that once Windows boots, an Apple-deployed script will run which &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; launch the Boot Camp installer, which contains all of your machine&#39;s drivers and which you&#39;ll definitely want to install immediately before you do anything else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Image 3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;the Windows Boot Camp Support installer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because each subsequent Windows release is dramatically improving its own eGPU support, before doing anything else you&#39;ll want to upgrade to the latest available stable version. For reference, my installer started me at Windows 10 version 1809, which wasn&#39;t the latest major release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent release at the time was 1903, but Windows 10 is especially precious about how it rolls out system updates across its install base, and actually does not expose a mechanism in the operating system to tell it &amp;quot;shut up, just give me the latest and greatest.&amp;quot; You can force-trigger a release by visiting a particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10?&#34;&gt;Microsoft web page&lt;/a&gt; and clicking &amp;quot;Update now&amp;quot;, however:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;update windows 10 page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&#39;ll take entirely too long to download, so go make a sandwich, I guess. I was too afraid of continuing with any configuration when so many things were likely to have been improved in the newer release. So I&#39;d recommend just waiting for this update to finish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;windows 10 update app&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enabling-windows-system-protection&#34;&gt;Enabling Windows system protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Windows has updated itself and restarted, we want to create a System Restore Point, so that we can easily unwind any driver &amp;amp; configuration changes we make if we run into trouble. You can do this by hitting the windows key and searching &amp;quot;restore point&amp;quot; to open this dialog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/3d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 10 System properties preferences&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;quot;Configure&amp;quot; restore settings, and in the subsequent dialog box choose &amp;quot;Turn on system protection&amp;quot; (how is this not on by default?!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;windows 10 system protection settings&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click OK, and in the previous pane, you should now be able to click &amp;quot;Create&amp;quot; a restore point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/3e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 10 system properties after system protection has been enabled&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be asked to name the restore point, and you can give it whatever name you want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/3f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Create a restore point dialog, named 1-initial-setup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-ddu-to-take-control-of-windows-gpu-drivers&#34;&gt;Running DDU to take control of Windows GPU drivers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, because Windows 10&#39;s built-in methods for locating and installing GPU drivers will often interfere with the chipmakers&#39; own software, prior to plugging in your eGPU or installing any AMD or Nvidia drivers, you actually want to &lt;em&gt;uninstall&lt;/em&gt; all GPU drivers and prevent Windows Update from attempting to install new ones. This can be done with a program called DDU which can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wagnardsoft.com&#34;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt; (I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wagnardsoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=1788&#34;&gt;version 18.0.1.5&lt;/a&gt;). The website looks like every other official home for software that runs on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;the DDU home page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the only download link that isn&#39;t a display ad will disappear every few seconds as part of a timed carousel animation, just wait until you can time your click such that you successfully download it. This took me no fewer than three tries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, run it and it&#39;ll complain that you&#39;re not in Windows Safe mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DDU launcher&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing and with this mix of hardware and software, it actually didn&#39;t appear to be possible to boot Windows 10 into Safe Mode under Boot Camp, so I just launched DDU anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was going to install a Radeon card, I selected AMD from the dropdown box near the top-right of the UI, resulting in the app shading itself like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The DDU UI after selecting AMD Radeon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, open the options and check the &amp;quot;Prevent downloads of drivers from &#39;Windows update&#39;&amp;quot; box at the bottom of the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DDU advanced options where you&#39;ll prevent downloads from Windows Update&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will prevent Windows Update from attempting to install any GPU drivers. Windows Update doesn&#39;t normally screw up GPU drivers once things are initially set up, but because you&#39;re likely going to be connecting and disconnecting a GPU with much greater regularity than you ever would on a traditional PC tower (much less into any of four different Thunderbolt 3 ports), the risk is much greater of Windows screwing up your GPU drivers when attempting to configure your eGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, after checking &amp;quot;prevent downloads&amp;quot;, close the options menu and then click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Clean and restart&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;in the top-left corner of DDU&#39;s interface. It may warn you again and you will ignore it, because you&#39;ve been using Windows for two hours at this point and you&#39;ve already dismissed twenty pointless warning dialogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DDU warning you will ignore&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that&#39;s done, restart, hit the Windows key and type &amp;quot;restore point&amp;quot; again to create a second restore point after you&#39;ve run DDU but before you&#39;ve downloaded your GPU&#39;s drivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/3b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A second restore point named 2-post-ddu&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-your-gpu-drivers&#34;&gt;Install your GPU drivers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next up, you should finally plug in your eGPU!&lt;/strong&gt; Give Windows a minute as the eGPU warms up to detect the Thunderbolt controller. If you open Device Manager you should see a display adapter named &amp;quot;Microsoft Basic Display Adapter&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/a3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Device manager&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check the properties of that (driverless) display adapter, they&#39;ll look like this;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Display adapter properties&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great! It means Windows is connecting to your eGPU enclosure&#39;s Thunderbolt 3 controller fine, and it can tell there&#39;s a GPU plugged into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we&#39;ll want to install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amd.com/en/support&#34;&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to download the &amp;quot;Auto-Detect and Install Radeon Graphics Drivers for Windows&amp;quot; installer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.geforce.com/drivers&#34;&gt;Download GeForce Experience&lt;/a&gt; under &amp;quot;Automatic Driver Updates&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation process for both is dead simple and fully automated. Either will prompt you to restart Windows, but &lt;strong&gt;don&#39;t click Restart&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, shut down the computer entirely. Once it&#39;s off, unplug the eGPU, boot it up again, login, and plug the eGPU back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not restart with the eGPU connected?&lt;/strong&gt; The hand-wavy short version is that when Windows boots normally on a Mac with an eGPU connected, the device is initialized in such a way by the EFI boot loader so as to not work as expected. (In my case, that meant Windows could never successfully boot if the eGPU was connected at boot time.) All this means that, out-of-the-box, you&#39;ll probably need to plug in your eGPU on Windows only after you&#39;re booted and logged in. There is a way around this, but it&#39;s not pretty—I&#39;ll explain below when I talk about rEFInd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so after you&#39;ve booted up again and re-plugged in your eGPU, go back to Device Manager. With any luck, the GPU will now be recognized for what it is within 20 or 30 seconds, and you should see the model name of the card you put in there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/a4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Device manager with a Radeon VII on it&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, when I view the properties of the AMD Radeon VII display adapter, everything looks good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/a2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a really good chance, however, that you&#39;ll see a yellow exclamation point over the GPU&#39;s icon, and instead of &amp;quot;This device is working properly&amp;quot;, you&#39;ll be greeted by &amp;quot;Error 12&amp;quot; and  a message that the device doesn&#39;t have sufficient resources (read: either memory addressing or bandwidth) to be used. If you see this, your GPU won&#39;t engage at all, and you&#39;ll have to troubleshoot it. There are a bunch of ideas &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/2016-macbook-pro-solving-egpu-error-12-in-windows-10/&#34;&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;, but what will work for you depends on a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you get too deep in the weeds trying to solve this, however, be sure to try connecting the eGPU to each of the four Thunderbolt 4 ports of your MacBook Pro, each separated by a system reboot. It may be the case that one of them works reliably (on the 13&amp;quot; models, the left-front port typically has the most available bandwidth for  Thunderbolt 3 PCIe devices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, if and when Windows reports the device is working properly, that means you should be able to drive an external display by connecting it to one of your card&#39;s output ports. You may be able to imagine that this requires significantly less bandwidth than looping back to the built-in monitor, because all the information involved is traveling in one direction (instructions move from the computer to the eGPU, and those rendered frames go from the eGPU onward to the monitor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve connected a second monitor, if you want to ensure no Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth is wasted on driving your MacBook&#39;s display, hit Windows-P repeatedly until you select &amp;quot;second screen only&amp;quot;, effectively disabling the notebook display under Windows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Windows display mode options&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adjust-windows-sleep-settings&#34;&gt;Adjust Windows sleep settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several eGPU enclosures as well as specific cards have a really hard time figuring out what to do with their fans when Windows goes to sleep. In my case, every time Windows slept or I closed my MacBook Pro&#39;s lid, both the GPU&#39;s and the enclosure&#39;s fans all began spinning at 100% speed, which—fun fact—was a very loud 59dB measured from about a meter away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this, I went through and disabled Windows sleep everywhere I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, hit the Windows key and type &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; to bring up the basic power preferences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/e3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I changed here was to set &amp;quot;When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Never&amp;quot;, which doesn&#39;t form a real sentence, but will solve the primary problem of eGPUs freaking out during Windows sleep. Note that it is safe to allow sleep when on battery power, since all eGPU enclosures supply power to the system over the Thunderbolt 3 cable, you&#39;re never &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plugged in when they&#39;re connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, click additional power settings and stumble around until you find this energy settings page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/e1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 10 energy settings&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, the most important is that you be able to close the lid without triggering Windows sleep when you&#39;re plugged in. But you can see I also disabled sleep when pressing the power button, as well as removing all sleep-related options from the start menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-some-benchmarks&#34;&gt;Run some benchmarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, you can start installing and trying out some games. To verify everything is working as you expect, it might make sense to run a benchmark. A free one you might try is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://benchmark.unigine.com/superposition&#34;&gt;Unigine &amp;quot;superposition&amp;quot; benchmark&lt;/a&gt;, which should be able to stress any GPU currently on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re not familiar, benchmarks are basically complex 3D rendered game-like environments that are scripted as opposed to being interactive. Running a 2 or 3 minute demo, benchmarks usually do just enough to heat up the GPU and measure how it performs under load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I was connected to a 4K monitor, I ran the benchmark at &amp;quot;4K optimized&amp;quot; and this setup yielded a score of 7037, whatever that means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/IMG_0249.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;benchmark results&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Razer Core V2 really doesn&#39;t hide any noise at all, so in addition to running fairly hot, it was definitely pretty loud: between 53-56dB from a meter away. Because I&#39;m used to modern GPUs being six feet away under a TV and in a massive noise-dampening case, the screeches and whines that result when the GPU is being put to work terrify me that something is wrong, but I have zero actual indication that I&#39;m being anything but paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-refind-boot-manager&#34;&gt;Install rEFInd Boot Manager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work around the issue of your eGPU being initialized improperly at boot-time when booting into Windows when the eGPU is connected, you can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/&#34;&gt;rEFInd&lt;/a&gt; as your boot manager specifically to &lt;em&gt;pretend&lt;/em&gt; that you&#39;re booting macOS each time you boot Windows for the purpose of hardware initialization. If this sounds dumb, it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only proceed with this section of installing rEFInd if you want to be able to perform a cold boot into Windows without first disconnecting the eGPU. It&#39;s a silly amount of security compromise and complexity for such a small quality of life improvement, but if you&#39;re going to be switching between Windows and macOS frequently, or if you&#39;re using a headless Mac like a Mac Mini, or if you&#39;re struggling to overcome &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/2016-macbook-pro-solving-egpu-error-12-in-windows-10/&#34;&gt;Error 12&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, installing rEFInd might be worth it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html&#34;&gt;download the binary zip file&lt;/a&gt; linked to from the project page. Extract the directory to someplace you can find easily from the command line for the next few steps. I put mine in my home directory: &lt;code&gt;/Users/justin/refind-bin-0.11.4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;disable-secure-boot&#34;&gt;Disable Secure Boot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Mac has a T2 chip, it is pre-configured to only boot Apple-approved operating systems, of which rEFInd most certainly is not. To disable this feature, reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode while holding Command-R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Recovery Mode, from the Utilities menu, open Startup Security Utility, and enter an administrator&#39;s password. It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/macos-high-sierra-startup-security-utility.png&#34; alt=&#34;startup security utility&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use rEFInd, you&#39;ll need to select &amp;quot;No Security&amp;quot; under &amp;quot;Secure Boot&amp;quot;. Once toggled, you can quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, from the Utility menu, launch the Terminal app. Here, you&#39;ll need to disable &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection&#34;&gt;System Integrity Protection&lt;/a&gt; (SIP) so that you can write to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition&#34;&gt;EFI system partition&lt;/a&gt; (ESP). To do this, in Terminal, execute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# csrutil disable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for this to take effect, you&#39;ll need to restart the Mac and hold command-R to reboot into Recovery Mode &lt;em&gt;yet again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back in Recovery Mode, you&#39;ll need to mount your main Mac partition so that you can get access to the rEFInd installer you downloaded previously. You can do this by launching Disk Utility from the Utilities menu, clicking &amp;quot;Macintosh HD&amp;quot; and clicking the &amp;quot;Mount&amp;quot; toolbar button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Image-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Disk Utility&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If FileVault is enabled, mounting the drive will require any user&#39;s password to unlock it. Now, quit Disk Utility and again open Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the disk is mounted, navigate to your home directory, which in my case is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/justin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, run rEFInd&#39;s install script, which I&#39;d placed right there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# refind-bin-0.11.4/refind-install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script will mount the EFI system partition to &lt;code&gt;/Volumes/ESP&lt;/code&gt;, install itself, and bless itself in the Mac&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063&#34;&gt;NVRAM&lt;/a&gt; so that upon boot, rEFInd is the first thing that&#39;s executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the installer exits, it will also report that it&#39;s copied a configuration file to &lt;code&gt;refind.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to edit this file to enable macOS hardware &amp;quot;spoofing&amp;quot; so that Windows has any chance of booting successfully while an eGPU is connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this command to open vim and edit the configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# vim /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind/refind.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t know vim, don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s not a lot to do here. Just follow exactly these keystrokes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;type &lt;code&gt;&#39;/spoof&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;position the cursor over the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; character at the beginning of the line that reads &lt;code&gt;#spoof_osx_version 10.9&lt;/code&gt; (you can use the arrow keys)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;hit the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; key to delete the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, effectively uncommenting it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;type &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter to write the file and quit vim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, now you know vim. Quit terminal, and shut down the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, each time you boot, you&#39;ll be treated to this really ugly splash page that will remind you of the year of Linux on the desktop, whichever year that was for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://justin.searls.co/uploads/egpu/Image 2-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;the rEFInd boot UI&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To boot Windows with macOS hardware spoofing, boot the first item on the left. Use the arrow keys and enter to launch it. For macOS, you want to select the second option. It&#39;s useful to keep in mind that rEFInd will automatically boot the previously used partition after a 20 second timeout. This is handy, because if you boot while you&#39;re in clamshell mode, you&#39;re not going to see this screen on your external display. Just wait, and eventually the machine will boot into whatever operating system you used most recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to switch between operating systems across boots, you&#39;ll need to either hit the correct arrow key at the right time or crack the lid to see what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-s-all-folks&#34;&gt;That&#39;s all, folks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you&#39;re now too tired to want to play any games with your now-capable-of-running-them MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, eGPUs represent an exciting branch of enthusiast computer hardware in an era of increasingly mundane and by-the-numbers computing upgrades. For being so niche and little known, there&#39;s clearly a ton of investment being made by multiple hardware manufacturers (with new enclosures hitting the market each quarter), by Apple and Microsoft (from whom, each operating system release over the last two years has improved eGPU support), and from Intel  (whose Thunderbolt 3 API for the eGPU spec has realized the dream of plug-and-play interoperability between hundreds of enclosure-and-GPU combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;ll be interesting to see where things go from here, and even if you don&#39;t have imminent plans to build your own travel-friendly PC gaming battle station, you might want to keep tabs on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://egpu.io&#34;&gt;eGPU.io forums&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/egpu&#34;&gt;/r/eGPU subreddit&lt;/a&gt; every now and again, because this sort of gaming configuration is getting easier all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For years, economists have been puzzling over why, despite unprecedented technological innovation since the dawn of the Internet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/special-report/2014/10/04/technology-isnt-working&#34;&gt;productivity is flat&lt;/a&gt;. Really, nobody seems to know why! Look no further than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.axios.com/productivity-crisis-wage-growth-artificial-intelligence-04b29a4c-4d79-4040-9b42-10a0a5f675b5.html&#34;&gt;this week’s news&lt;/a&gt; to find a consensus opinion that the just-around-the-corner cure for lagging productivity numbers is—wait for it—more technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Productivity&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity#Labour_productivity&#34;&gt;curiously-named economic measure&lt;/a&gt; that essentially boils down to “amount of money you generate for your employer over time.” And because the promise of most technology is to enable people to do work faster, we should expect technology’s useful impact to be measurable, even with an (oversimplified) equation like &lt;strong&gt;Labor + Technology = Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something has clearly gone wrong. If we work backwards, we already know productivity is flat. And we are equally certain that technology has improved over the last twenty years. That leaves just one variable for which a negative value could explain the productivity gap: maybe we’re literally doing less useful work every day. Reflecting on my own experience, I’d go a step further and ask, &lt;em&gt;what if recent technological advances are actually decreasing our productivity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;busy-productive&#34;&gt;Busy != Productive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your personal capacity for deep insight and creative thought today versus a time in which you were less constantly connected to the world. Ask yourself, how often do you find your dreams for the day’s efforts unfulfilled, especially after you realize it’s now 5pm, as if you’ve been lost in a fugue state, spending the bulk of the day compulsively refreshing a rotation of various inboxes (e-mail, texts, chat), and never successfully finding a productive groove to accomplish whatever you’d set out to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I might feel &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tired at the end of the day and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; deserving of both a paycheck and a cold beverage, I’m often unconfident that I’ve &lt;em&gt;actually earned&lt;/em&gt; either. I’m &lt;strong&gt;busy&lt;/strong&gt; all day, every day; but I’m &lt;strong&gt;productive&lt;/strong&gt; so rarely that I’m too ashamed to estimate a figure here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, our dutiful reactions to inbound communication is having the exact same effect on our friends and colleagues! We may be trying to demonstrate timely responsiveness, but to others we’re the person on the other side of the net, volleying their hot potatoes right back at them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for the minority of users who successfully disable unnecessary notifications and curate their inboxes, it won’t fix the broader problem that software is training most users to spend their days oscillating between being interrupted by notifications and being distracted by the compulsive tendency to stay on top of an array of disparate inboxes (for whom what little time that remains is wiped out by theh &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/attention-residue-is-ruining-your-concentration.html&#34;&gt;attention residue&lt;/a&gt; effect). This wouldn’t be a problem but for the fact that &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt; are sending me two orders of magnitude more texts, tweets, and e-mails than they were a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wait-i-clicked-because-the-title-said-iphone-and-now-i-feel-baited&#34;&gt;Wait, I clicked because the title said “iPhone” and now I feel baited&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this post’s title blames a general societal problem on Apple &lt;em&gt;expressly because&lt;/em&gt; we’ve reached a point where only provocative clickbait headlines pierce through the noise we’re surrounded by. So, let’s get right down to it and talk about the iPhone and how it was at least the &lt;em&gt;harbinger&lt;/em&gt; of this dystopia we now find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an adopter of the original iPhone in 2007, I’ll never forget the glares I earned when I was caught ignoring my (much more interesting, but smartphone-less) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/beckyjoy&#34;&gt;spouse&lt;/a&gt; during dinner. Or the dawn of a worry that whenever I stole a few minutes from uninteresting work assignments to check the news on my phone, I’d return to the work only to find it even less interesting than I did before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unintended problems caused by increasing connectedness didn’t fade with time, it was the perception that &lt;em&gt;these are problems at all&lt;/em&gt; that decreased as meteoric smartphone adoption gradually normalized our collective state of permanent distraction. If anything, iPhone’s subsequent innovations have only exacerbated these problems. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service&#34;&gt;APNS&lt;/a&gt; made these distractions pro-active, plentiful, and instantaneous. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction&#34;&gt;IAP&lt;/a&gt; opened the door to hyper-optimized monetization of distraction under the guise of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsion_loop&#34;&gt;gameplay loops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/&#34;&gt;Continuity&lt;/a&gt; worked to multicast distraction across every one of our screens, ensuring that our ring tones would play in surround sound every time we received a spam phone call. I wish it was satire to say you’d be hard-pressed to design a touch interface that more closely resembled a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber&#34;&gt;Skinner box&lt;/a&gt; than the p&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-to-refresh&#34;&gt;ull-to-refresh&lt;/a&gt; UI control that the iPhone made famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an individual user, I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://heyfocus.com&#34;&gt;exerted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://inthemoment.io&#34;&gt;an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321&#34;&gt;absurd&lt;/a&gt; amount of effort to shut out these distractions, and I still struggle daily with what amounts to an addiction to novel-seeming-but-rarely-very-novel distractions. If my own efforts have proven so futile, it’s left me to wonder: am I unusually addicted or am I, as an early adopter, unusually ahead of the curve in realizing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have stumbled upon similar ponderings in recent years, but few have attempted to take an inventory of specific classifications of how modern software platforms distract people. Fewer still have bothered to imagine or propose potential solutions to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive deeper! I’m going to detail five types of problems that increased “connectedness” has posed as well as some potential solutions for each. Regardless of whether Apple is to blame for having caused these issues, they are undeniably the only company in a position to fix any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Apple is unveiling iOS 12 &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/&#34;&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s an opportune time for us to ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_hairforceone?&#34;&gt;Craig Federighi&lt;/a&gt; to consider tacking a few announcements onto his Keynote deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-death-by-a-thousand-banners&#34;&gt;1. Death by a thousand banners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For having built what is certainly the largest-scale notification system on the planet, iOS notifications sure are dumb. None of Apple’s platforms have a concept of batching notifications, much less intelligently prioritizing them. This issue is self-evident to anyone who texts often with a chatty sender while they try to get literally anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1t1NoY-vmXKqjqq0u4KnMA.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Me, trying to focus while swiping away some rando‘s texts&#34; /&gt;
Me, trying to focus while swiping away some rando‘s texts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t iMessage batch notifications? Especially if the user has indicated (through the swipe-up-to-dismiss gesture) that they don’t want to see them? And why trust every app to implement this sort of self-policing, when the underlying platform can better infer a user’s intent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this line of reasoning just a step further, why doesn’t iOS defer unlikely-to-be-urgent notifications until users are in a good context for dealing with them? Free ideas of things iOS could do here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize notifications based on app, usage behavior, and content (all of which Apple has) and decide whether to alert the user immediately, on the hour, in a digest at the end of the day, or to suppress them entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Continuity for good by muzzling notifications across all devices when the user likely can’t act on them. My Apple Watch knows when I’m running, so what good does it do to wake my Mac’s screen to catch an e-mail notification out the corner of my eye, other than to stress me out for the rest of my jog? (As it stands, I’d get those notifications on the watch, too, even during a workout)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring its devices’ sensors to bear by identifying and reacting to various life contexts. For example, Siri will likely soon be able to identify its user’s specific voice, so if a microphone detects said user is in the middle of speaking during a conversation, don’t interrupt their train of thought by tapping their watch or buzzing their phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish those contexts across devices. If I’m located in my living room and there’s a movie playing on my Apple TV that ends in five minutes, why can’t a notification to my phone be delayed until the credits start rolling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many cases, stop listing notifications on the lock screen. Unless the user is clearly waking the device to respond to a notification, it’s likely their intent was to do &lt;em&gt;literally anything else&lt;/em&gt;, and the presence of an unrelated notification is likely to distract them from accomplishing that intention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subtextual reason that none of the above are obvious, must-have features is because it’s treated as axiomatic that the best notification response time possible is “instant”. Apple has essentially achieved that, and we have collectively accrued plenty of life experience to suggest it was not the right metric to optimize for. Most of the things our devices notify us of aren’t as valuable as the time we lose to being distracted by (and then recovering from) them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-our-inboxes-have-inboxes&#34;&gt;2. Our inboxes have inboxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only this were only about notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week I started college, I only had three inboxes I was sure to check every day: my one (and then, only) e-mail address, a physical answering machine I had mounted to my dorm’s wall, and my physical mail box in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve ditched the answering machine for voicemail, and I still have only one physical mailbox, but I have 5 e-mail addresses across various organizations. Oh, and I also have to check Twitter, of course. And Instagram comments. And Facebook (simply on account of cross-posting from Instagram). Also Facebook’s Messenger (which I loathe using, but which is the only way a number of people ever contact me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most users will never change any of their system’s default settings, many savvy users have disabled the vast majority of distracting notifications. But the world has already moved on, and our various social groups largely expect us to stay abreast of one or more inboxes where they communicate. This has led many of us to develop compulsive tendency to visit a round-robin of inboxes and refresh each of them, which can take so much time that once I’m done, I go right back to checking the first inbox. It’s true that some of my friends have successfully declared bankruptcy from ever checking this or that app, but it often comes at the expense of walling themselves off from some group of people, and at work it requires the privilege to be able to get away with ignoring colleagues for hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is when I realized how toxic “inbox creep” has become. Not only am I and most of my friends a member of numerous Slack organizations (at the time of this writing, I have been added to 25 of them), each organization represents an unbounded number of inboxes. You have the default &lt;code&gt;#general&lt;/code&gt; channel, sure. But each topic the organization aims to cover is generally represented by its own separate channel, each representing its own unread message counter. Look no further than this &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mathowie/status/837735473745289218&#34;&gt;comically complex flow chart&lt;/a&gt; attempting to document the rules Slack must have in place to notify users of new messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, and I can’t repeat this loudly enough, &lt;strong&gt;every app that displays a badge icon represents 1-to-n inboxes you are responsible for checking.&lt;/strong&gt; The mere act of clearing inboxes is time-intensive work that provides next-to-no value and at a tremendous opportunity cost by risking that users will mistake the resulting fatigue for accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be done about this? Well, for starters, Apple could rethink the badge UI it places over every app icon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both the iOS and macOS app switcher (which is only brought up when a user intends to switch to a specific app), is it really appropriate to display the unread badge on every recent app, potentially directing users to open an app &lt;em&gt;other than the one they actually intended to open&lt;/em&gt;? No well-designed product would actively disrupt a user’s intention to open, say, a Pages document by showing them that &lt;em&gt;Somebody Might Have Said Something in Slack&lt;/em&gt; while they Command-Tab over. I’d nix the badge UI altogether in app switchers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple could build a single unified inbox app (call it Inbox) that collated every apps’ notifications and into a simple UI that was actually effective for triaging them. The current Notification Center UI is not (as much as Apple keeps trying to make it) a destination that anyone actually visits on purpose. But what if this Inbox was the only place you needed to check to ensure you hadn’t just missed out on anything? One place in which all notifications were organized in a way that made it easy to categorize, schedule, dismiss, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationaction&#34;&gt;act on&lt;/a&gt; them? It’s hard to imagine Apple actually pulling this off, but their role as platform holder makes them the only ones with sufficient access to our data to creating such an app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current design of the badge assigns a number of pixels in proportion to its unread count to every app’s badge, but odds are that a&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; badge over iMessage is more important to a user than the badge over a &lt;code&gt;24,058&lt;/code&gt; badge over a free-to-play game I’ve only ever opened once. Why not use both local and (anonymized) crowd-sourced data to detect notification abusers and deemphasize or hide badges that the user isn’t acting on? Proactive measures could be taken to mitigate a latent stressor that most users don’t even realize they suffer from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-allow-once-allow-forever&#34;&gt;3. “Allow” once, “Allow” forever&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, iOS offers each app you install &lt;em&gt;exactly one&lt;/em&gt; opportunity to enable notifications. This dramatically raises the stakes for app makers, because if a user declines to receive notifications that might be the difference between profiting off their engagement or losing them until they happen to reinstall the app. As a result, many apps have gone out of their way to both badger users into enabling notifications and to assert maximum systems access (badges, persistent banners, sounds, etc) once they’re enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the onboarding experience to Facebook Messenger, in 4 parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NUOPihDafvKT377XRW06FQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;First, a _pre-flight_ that the app is about to take its one shot at requesting systems access from the user (where Not Now tries to convince you to accept&#34; /&gt;
First, a &lt;em&gt;pre-flight&lt;/em&gt; that the app is about to take its one shot at requesting systems access from the user (where Not Now tries to convince you to accept&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YX5YjolvpbjyUpSmAqLC_A.png&#34; alt=&#34;The standard operating system prompt asking the user whether to allow notifications to be sent to their device&#34; /&gt;
The standard operating system prompt asking the user whether to allow notifications to be sent to their device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tap “Don’t Allow” above, the app will actually punish you in a cruel twist of irony by treating the  lack of notifications &lt;em&gt;as a notification itself:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZJkLjMS0WTiPvpCp95DRrw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;That \`1\` notification over my profile picture is not there to let me know someone messaged me&#34; /&gt;
That `1` notification over my profile picture is not there to let me know someone messaged me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tapping that camoflauged notification reveals only an urgent-looking setting to once again beat you over the head with entreaties to enable notifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYB8YOSv-xFgTkZ3_pC7Bg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A “notification” that, once tapped, tells you that your life is empty and without purpose if you don’t enable OS-level notification access&#34; /&gt;
A “notification” that, once tapped, tells you that your life is empty and without purpose if you don’t enable OS-level notification access&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this Notifications “notification” cannot be dismissed and will continue to annoy users for the life of their use of the app. This is such obviously exploitative design that I’m a little surprised Apple hasn’t already addressed it with Facebook, but I suspect the reason they haven’t taken action is because the vast majority of users will blindly tap “Allow” on every prompt the first time they launch the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you tap “Allow” on that prompt exactly one time? Well, then the OS takes grants that app permission to bother the user in perpetuity, interrupting them with sounds, badges, banners, waking up the device’s screen, and tapping the watch as often as it wants and for as long as it wants. Once initially allowed, notifications receive nearly zero subsequent moderation from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, iOS offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925&#34;&gt;pretty granular privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; about which &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of notifications an app can send, but no ability to throttle or de-prioritize them. And if the number of users who tap “Don’t Allow” is too small for the above behavior to be seen as a problem, I’m hesitant to guess how few users will ever venture to an app’s Notifications preference pane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple could improve this situation dramatically by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating App Store policies to explicitly disallow this sort of user-shaming behavior and to start banning apps that violate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage its massive wealth of information to identify apps that represent statistical outliers (say, apps that send the most notifications relative to users acting on them) and raise concern with the developer under the veiled threat that their access to APNS might be throttled or blocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically suggesting to users that they trim down their notification settings based on onboard usage analytics (e.g. “You’ve ignored the last 40 ‘Clash of Clans’ events it’s notified you of, disable this type of notification?”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the “Allow” dialog to include more control over exactly &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; types of notifications the user chooses to opt into, similar to how the Location Services dialog was updated to allow users to choose whether an app should alway have access or only when the app is in use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-negativity-feedback-loops&#34;&gt;4. Negativity feedback loops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost popularly-accepted wisdom now that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/social-media-is-making-us-depressed-lets-learn-to-turn-it-off-a6974526.html&#34;&gt;social media is making people more depressed&lt;/a&gt;, but little is being done to address this beyond individuals’ occassional performative deletion of one’s Facebook account on Twitter or of one’s Twitter account on Instagram or of one’s Instagram account on Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent episode &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast&#34;&gt;his show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ezraklein&#34;&gt;Ezra Klein&lt;/a&gt; said (paraphrasing), “the time I’m most likely to go on Instagram is when I feel most lonely… and it almost always leaves me feeling worse.” That really resonated with my own experience with that (and other) “social” apps. In fact, I think it’s the description of a really common feedback loop, in which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person feels bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They open a “social” app to feel better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That experience makes them feel worse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time passes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person still feels bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GOTO Step #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the only metric that defines success for an ad-supported social media app is maximal engagement, this vicious cycle is a &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt;, not a bug. Apple, who is fond of bragging that such engagement is &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/tim-cook-says-apples-customers-are-not-its-products-unlike-facebook/&#34;&gt;not its business model&lt;/a&gt; in contrast to Facebook, is also the only fully-integrated platform holder that can hope to help people break from this negative feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log the amount of time spent on each app, and for apps that people open dozens or hundreds of times a day, actively suggest to users that they consider checking it less frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, give users the tools to proactively restrict their access to apps and websites they believe to be exploitative or addictive. Restrictions could take the form of limiting screen time devoted to the app, which time of day it can be accessed, or just block it outright to help people break unhealthy habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage the increasing biometric data available on devices to (securely but inevitably creepily) monitor information like a user’s perceived emotional state based on their heart rate and facial expressions over time and make real-time suggestions when their emotional well-being might be suffering. This could be as simple as suggesting the user take a break from the device or as specific as a warning like, “your stress level has increased since you opened Instagram 15 minutes ago.” Subsequent calls-to-action could encourage the user to switch activities to something less obvious but more likely to improve their mood (I am always happier after calling my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeffwenzinger&#34;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, but coordinating our schedules is just barely high-friction enough that I tend to bum myself out by checking Twitter instead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-several-people-are-typing&#34;&gt;5. Several people are typing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/holman&#34;&gt;Zach Holman&lt;/a&gt; give some rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/&#34;&gt;his talk about work at GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, one point he hammered home was how much of their productivity was unlocked by “asynchronous communication.” Instead of having comparatively synchronous calls and meetings to update one another on their work’s status, the utopian world depicted in the talk was one in which people could drop a note in the team’s chat (then &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/retired/campfire&#34;&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;, but these days Slack) with zero expectation that other members immediately read or respond to it. When each person controls when they go and check the chat room, their productive flow isn’t at the mercy of interruption or whatever times of day meetings might have been scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very good point, and one that I really bought into for a few years. But then we all went and completely ruined chat apps with push notifications, online/offline status bubbles, and typing indicators. Because even though a chat room might &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like an async, pull-based communication medium, in reality most people will have default notifications pestering them constantly all day. Or their team will slowly and subconsciously grow to equate a green “online” status bubble with “at work” and an “offline” bubble as meaning “absent from work”. And while it might feel like you can fire off a comment and then immediately get back to work, in truth most people will wait a little while for an immediate reply, see a typing indicator and then wait on it, falling right back into extremely latent synchronous communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typing indicator UI controls manage to rob the user of their full attention for indeterminate periods of time while offering virtually nothing useful for the user to do while they stare at the app. Worse, often someone will start typing a reply only to give up entirely after 30 seconds, often in the interest of not wasting others’ time! How much cumulative time have you spent watching a typing indicator start, then stop, then start again only to have it disappear entirely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, Slack’s iOS app can be configured to disable the typing indicator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*keoET8XHoutCUCA1b2bwsg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;You should probably uncheck this&#34; /&gt;
You should probably uncheck this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all to say nothing of the other risks inherent in replacing equally accessible, high bandwidth voice and video chats with often semi-synchronous text chats, which often consume more time and convey less situational and emotional context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how could Apple make this better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill the typing indicator in iMessage, full stop. There’s no point showing the user something they can’t act on and the benefit of knowing to pause and wait for more messages are outweighed by the costs (and might be separately improved by better notification batching)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, defer sending non-urgent communication in its own apps, as a sort of society-wide &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff&#34;&gt;exponential backoff algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. For example, by default, Mail.app could send new e-mails after a random 5, 15, or 30 minute when a user hits “Send”. This could be marketed as giving ample time to correct any mistakes, but it would have the happy side effect of preventing people from turning e-mail into a de facto instant messaging client (a thing that actually happens at numerous workplaces). This could all be accomplished while still giving users an explicit “Send now” action when a message is truly time-sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-not-disturb-while-living&#34;&gt;Do Not Disturb while living&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought a lot about Apple’s “Do Not Disturb while driving” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imore.com/do-not-disturb-while-driving-ios-11-can-change-your-habits-if-you-let-it&#34;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; for last year’s iOS 11, especially since it was the only feature even tangentially related to my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/my-counter-cultural-ios-11-wish-list-89531c8053db&#34;&gt;wish list of features&lt;/a&gt; for that iOS release. The feature has its quirks but it works well enough most of the time. What’s always struck me odd about Do Not Disturb while driving isn’t what it is or how it works, but rather that it exists at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple clearly thinks notifications are great, because almost all of their platforms are lousy with them. But here is this one very particular case in which Apple has signaled that being notified is Not Okay™, because receiving a notification while operating a vehicle could present a personal and public health risk. And yet, so far we’ve seen few signs that Apple has reflected much on the other personal and public risks posed by the global-scale connectedness their platforms have enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all makes me wonder whether anyone at Apple has a full time job to ask and answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user uses an app more often, is that a sign it’s genuinely benefiting them or might using the app be triggering or exacerbating a mental health issue like depression or addiction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user interacts with an Apple device, how often do they perform the activity and immediately put it away successfully? How often do they stay on the device, distracted by other things? How often does a notification or badge icon ultimately derail them from doing the thing they set out to do in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the always-on, distracting nature of iOS and other modern software platforms partly to blame for the unrealized productivity gains normally predicted by technical innovation? How many trillions of dollars might have been wiped out from global GDP figures around the world due to Apple’s Push Notification Service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we mitigate the damage that connectedness has wrought on our default levels of focus and capacity for creative, productive work, what &lt;em&gt;proactive&lt;/em&gt; things could Apple be doing to actually enhance our productivity beyond that baseline? (I can’t be the only one who used to joke I was way more productive on planes, at least until wi-fi on planes became ubiquitous.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Apple doesn’t have teams dedicated to this problem, they should. I don’t know about you, but I’d gladly pay $2000  for this year’s flagship iPhone if it could save me a commensurate amount of time by keeping me less unnecessarily connected. Life’s too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, if you enjoyed this post, you might also like the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692&#34;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;. (Though, by having successfully made it all the way to the bottom of this post, you may need the book less than I did.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Rules</title>
      <link>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/10-rules-54243f9b9aed/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 20:57:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>justin@searls.co (Justin Searls)</author>
      <guid>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/10-rules-54243f9b9aed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here it is, the post that enumerates all of the ways in which remote work has turned me into a total weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost a decade now I’ve been working from home, enjoying the unusual freedoms—and anxieties—that it brings. If a single theme has emerged, it’s this: by default, I’m an undisciplined mess. When given the choice between short-term distractions and long-term goals, I’ll take the passing hit of instant gratification every time. (This paragraph took me ten minutes to write because I was text messaging back-and-forth with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hone02&#34;&gt;@hone02&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one thing can overcome my lack of self control: &lt;strong&gt;replace all my good intentions with hard and fast rules,&lt;/strong&gt; then stick to them so rigidly that my constant fear of failure will inadvertently be put to productive use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about several of these before, but I’ve never tried to write down all the self-imposed rules I’ve laid down for myself over the last decade. One thing they all have in common is that they’re simple, but hard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No breakfast, no lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, no calories at all until 5pm every day. This is the first thing I’ve found to make my weight easily manageable since I was in 4th grade. I’ve allowed myself four exceptions so far in 2017, usually due to social obligations or special occasions. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/why-i-don-t-eat-before-dark-29536618a1ac&#34;&gt;More on my fasting rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same uniform, every day&lt;/strong&gt;. I own 12 black &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.americanapparel.com/en/tri-blend-crewneck-track-t-shirt_tr401&#34;&gt;American Apparel shirts&lt;/a&gt;, 12 pairs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5J8E94/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Darn Tough wool socks&lt;/a&gt;, 12 pairs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0MN02/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;ExOfficio boxer briefs,&lt;/a&gt; and 2 pairs of jeans. By wearing the same thing every day, I’ve saved a ton of time (laundry is now a simple match-3 game) and money (because I don’t care how stupid I look anymore). Committing to this rule completely changed my self image, which is now much more concerned with my behavior than my appearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel in under 10 pounds with a 19L bag&lt;/strong&gt;. I travel in a Tom Bihn &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-19&#34;&gt;Synapse 19&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/searls/c2a26d90fe97ecbe6c456991828d0c2a&#34;&gt;these Accroutements&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes weeks on end, with only minor adjustments based on climate and whether I’m giving a conference talk (at which point I’ll swap out my 10.5&amp;quot; iPad for a 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro). I no longer fret about whether I’ll secure overhead space or where I’ll stash my bag once I get wherever I’m going, because it’s light enough to always keep with me. When I need something, I always know exactly where it will be. Oh, and it takes me less than five minutes to pack an empty bag with my typical load-out, which is useful when you take over twenty trips each year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block known distractions from my devices&lt;/strong&gt;. I wrote this summer about how liberating it can be to &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/giving-the-ipad-a-full-time-job-3ae2440e1810&#34;&gt;work full-time from an iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and a big reason for my productivity has been to keep &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321&#34;&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/a&gt; enabled at all times (and as much as I can get away with on my iPhone). Additionally, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://1blocker.com&#34;&gt;1Blocker&lt;/a&gt; on iOS and macOS to revoke my access to every site that I habitually reach for when I’m craving stimulation. To keep myself focused on macOS, I use the aptly named &lt;a href=&#34;https://heyfocus.com&#34;&gt;Focus app&lt;/a&gt; to do the same, budgeting 30 minutes’ worth of breaks each day to catch up on Twitter and iMessage (I’ve recently added Slack to my blacklist and I’m kicking myself for not doing it sooner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run 5k every day, at 8 miles per hour&lt;/strong&gt;. If you were to drop me off at a gym in my 20s and told me to exercise, I’d flail about uselessly for an hour or two before eventually finding myself watching TV from an elliptical. Contrast that to today, where I just cleared a four year streak of never missing my daily 5k run and—when I can find a treadmill—maintaining a constant speed of 8mph. (Yes, that means I’ve had to embarrasingly run multiple 5ks in airport terminals.) Why mix metric and imperial targets? Because the alternative was no regular exercise, so I picked the first numbers that came to mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No device chargers in the bedroom&lt;/strong&gt;. This was pretty common advice for at least a decade before I finally relented and acknowledged that setting my bedtime to “whenever my phone falls on my face” was not a winning strategy for good sleep. We now have a bay of chargers set up across the hall, and my fear of missing an important call or alarm has never been realized (we use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/play1.html&#34;&gt;Sonos Play:1&lt;/a&gt; for alarms)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 minutes of meditation between work and play&lt;/strong&gt;. When you work from home, the line between work-life and life-life blur to such an extent that having a little ceremony to switch between operating modes proved necessary. I don’t know whether meditation per se is providing these benefits, but stopping work and sitting in the dark for 10-to-15 minutes is proving much more effective than precariously unwinding over two cocktails and three hours every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No food on Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;. Watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/u/509653a83bb7&#34;&gt;Becky&lt;/a&gt;’s tremendous success with a keto diet combined with sporadic longer-term fasting, I wanted to get in on multi-day fasting, too, but just don’t have the self control to pull it off on my own. Halfway through a committed fast I’d find some rationalization for breaking it early. But once we agreed to consistently say “no food on Wednesdays”, it’s been much easier (but, alas, still not easy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn Japanese every day&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, I use the vocabulary training app &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wanikani.com&#34;&gt;WaniKani&lt;/a&gt; (along with less structured source material). My rule is simple: clear my review backlog every day by the time I go to bed. The result is that after 13 years of attempting to learn Japanese, I’m finally learning it. I’ve attained a command of over 1000 kanji in just 11 months, which is a massive improvement on the 100-or-so I knew previously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First walk, then stand, then sit&lt;/strong&gt;. When I’m in town, I start every morning working from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFo1XA-Rd3R/?taken-by=searls&#34;&gt;rugged treadmill desk&lt;/a&gt; of my brother &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/u/2b360d05ad26&#34;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA5TA4PRd9Y/?taken-by=searls&#34;&gt;design&lt;/a&gt;. That means I get about ten miles of walking in each day in addition to my run. By the afternoon, I’m usually pretty sick of being in the basement and migrate to my standing desk upstairs. By 4pm, I’m pretty exhausted, so I pull up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039MIMRO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;crappy drafting chair&lt;/a&gt; and sit down. My favorite thing about incorporating a walking desk into my day is that my body is fatigued to a an extent that’s commensurate with my brain each day, and come 5pm both feel like they’ve done a real day’s work (of course, whether either really has is usually debatable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I missed something, so if you catch me doing something weird, be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;tweet at me&lt;/a&gt; about it (everyone else does).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[A translation of this post is available&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/rocketcafe001/ipad-full-time-job-4e4f0523ee08&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;in Chinese&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers often describe their ideal tools with adjectives like “powerful”, “feature-rich”, and “highly-configurable”. Few users are seen as wanting &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; from their computers than programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This popular notion agrees with our general intuition that more capability intrinsically yields greater productivity. My lived experience suggests, however, that while capability is a prerequisite for productivity, the two hardly share a linear correlation. A dozen ways to do the same thing just results in time-wasting &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis&#34;&gt;analysis paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. Apps packed with features to cover every conceivable need will slowly crowd out the tool’s primary use. Every extra configuration option that I delight in tweaking is another if-else branch in the system, requiring its developers to test more and change less, slowing the pace of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z8lajn_1giEmcc-y6IZyBQ@2x.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Mistakenly conflating capability and productivity is the reason why Microsoft started calling itself a “productivity” company&#34; /&gt;
Mistakenly conflating capability and productivity is the reason why Microsoft started calling itself a “productivity” company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve come around to a more nuanced view of productivity: that of a tenuous balance between friction and focus. “Friction” is the necessary turning of knobs on my tools in order to do work. “Focus” is the intentional ommission of knobs from tools to foster clear thinking. Any knowledge worker must balance their own creative action with thoughtful attention, and every software interface crystallizes an attempt at striking such a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve owned all-but-one model iPhone, but I’m not doing much to celebrate our 10-year anniversary. The iPhone changed my life in countless ways, but its greatest long-term effect has been the dulling of my introspective and creative faculties. I’ve grown uncomfortable with boredom, consuming news at every idle moment. I’ve arranged for myself a menagerie of pull-to-refresh Skinner boxes, which have seriously affected how my brain regulates dopamine. On the rare occasion I manage to buckle down and focus, a notification will inevitably &lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/attention-residue-is-ruining-your-concentration.html&#34;&gt;steal minutes of my attention&lt;/a&gt; with a mere ten-second context switch. It’s hard to discuss productivity in any serious way without acknowledging how much our tools and our brains have changed since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, I assumed working on a desktop computer would continue to provide refuge from this era of distraction, but then Apple went and brought all the fun &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/live-from-apples-back-to-the-mac-event/&#34;&gt;Back to the Mac&lt;/a&gt;. And while it’s possible to opt-out of a lot of the things that make the Mac less productive, I can’t deny that the root problem is that my experience carrying an iPhone everywhere I go has changed &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; in profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a depressing example. Desktop operating systems’ windowing features used to represent a net productivity boost — I could see two things at once, drag between them, and get more done in less time. But this stopped being the case at some point in the post-iPhone age. Here’s why: the mere &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of any windows in the corner of my screen will prompt my brain to think &lt;em&gt;if I type&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;⌘-Space &amp;quot;tw&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;, I could have Tweetbot fill that void on the left side of my desktop / soul&lt;/em&gt;. And every time, as if I’d entered some kind of fugue state, 30 minutes will have elapsed with me getting absolutely nothing done, leaving a mess of browser tabs open, and with an elevated heart-rate on account of feeling antagonized by an unkind rando on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F3ZUuqSgp4YQOTzgQUJDXQ@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;2007 Justin would see an editor and a browser, but 2017 Justin can only see unutilized space that could be occupied by Twitter, Mail, or Slack&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I’ve aspirationally purchased several iPads over the years thinking “maybe this time will be different.” And each time, it’s fallen short of enabling me to do real work. This most recent attempt, I’m happy to report, has finally been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using an iPad exclusively for work for 4 weeks (switching over to the 10.5&amp;quot; iPad Pro once it came out), and I’ve gotten much more meaningful work done — coding included — than I normally do. My greatest concern is that my more expensive Macs are starting to collect dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long post, but that&#39;s because I’m not only using the iPad to solve a simple tooling problem, I’m using it to solve a mental one as well. I’ve found there is no way to usefully distinguish our software tools from our thought processes: each informs and influences the other. So, yes, it’s easy for me to list off the tools I’m using and why they’re so great (and we’ll dispense with those in but a moment). But I also hope that by reflecting on my broader motivations, you might question some of your own preconceptions, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quick-overview&#34;&gt;A quick overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, you’re probably looking for some top-line summary of which apps I’m using to do what and whether it’s working out. Here’s a quick summary of how I’ve been working on an iPad all day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-i-m-doing&#34;&gt;What I’m doing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m currently using Apple’s whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BUxZAXMlsWs/?taken-by=searls&#34;&gt;kit-and-caboodle&lt;/a&gt;: 10.5&amp;quot; iPad Pro, AirPods, Apple Pencil, and Smart Keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 10.5&amp;quot; iPad is an amazing piece of hardware. The display is incredible, even in direct sunlight. The UI’s performance is generally as good or better than a high-end MacBook Pro. It’s shockingly lightweight. Any other high-end tablet is a literal joke next to this thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I code on my iPad for multiple hours every day, and I am now significantly faster than I am on my Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve found that virtually any painful-to-accomplish task can be automated away to some extent with the excellent (and recently Apple-acquired) &lt;a href=&#34;https://workflow.is&#34;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; app, so I’ve been pretty aggressive in creating an automated workflow as soon as I recognize a certain action is more awkward than necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I need to read an article or brainstorm my approach, I detach the keyboard and lean back with the Pencil. Each time, it gives me a terrific mental energy boost, especially when compared to hunching forward to stare at a screen all day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stick with Apple’s so-called “stock” apps pretty religiously, and find that maintaining a united front of Calendar, Mail, Reminders, Notes, and so on tends to lubricate the interactions between my devices, Siri, iCloud, and the apps themselves. They are by no means perfect, but a third-party replacement app would need to be impossibly remarkable to compensate for the loss of synergy. For more on this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethclifford.me/2015/06/bravely-default/&#34;&gt;Seth Clifford outlined&lt;/a&gt; reasoning similar to my own thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also do a lot of manager-ey stuff, so in addition to spending a lot of my time in the aforementioned stock and iWork apps, I’m often using &lt;a href=&#34;https://zoom.us&#34;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.expensify.com&#34;&gt;Expensify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pipedrive.com/en/welcomeback&#34;&gt;Pipedrive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mindnode.com&#34;&gt;MindNode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ68Lc6dnUAhUh6YMKHZn7CrUQFggoMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myscript.com%2Fnebo%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNETyEMNhR3cftXSqVuFmH3YBMANDA&#34;&gt;Nebo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzpO3l6dnUAhUL1oMKHeG2D4kQFgg4MAI&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fpaper-by-fiftythree-sketch-diagram-take-notes%2Fid506003812%3Fmt%3D8&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHBHi0t4_Df93TZlQfGofhEFbEyyA&#34;&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;, and (sigh) &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.com&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-i-m-doing-it&#34;&gt;Why I’m doing it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I mentioned above, I can no longer trust myself to not get bogged down in distraction when I have a full-blown windowing system at my disposal. I’ve already found that the combination of full-screen-by-default apps and Do Not Disturb mode have helped me retrain my impulse to constantly check Slack, Mail, and Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I travel very light (I’ll go weeks with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-19&#34;&gt;19L bag&lt;/a&gt; and less than &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BROPE86lYUY/?taken-by=searls&#34;&gt;10 pounds of stuff&lt;/a&gt;), so a 1lb iPad is twice as appealing as a 2lb MacBook (much less my 4lb 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of my least-favorite &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&#34;&gt;single-page web apps&lt;/a&gt; have reasonably good iPad apps, so instead of tweeting about how glitchy their crappy JavaScript is, I’m experiencing less friction by using their iOS apps’ more accessible native UI controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been “using” Unix for fifteen years, but never in earnest. When the going gets tough — maybe I don’t know a particular way to search for something, or maybe I need to move around large hunks of code — I immediately fall back on familiar graphical apps. The ability to command-tab to &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io&#34;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://rowanj.github.io/gitx/&#34;&gt;Gitx&lt;/a&gt; has enabled me to put off figuring out how to work effectively with the Unix toolchain. On iPad, I’m forced to do 100% of my work from the command line, and as a result I’ve finally taken the time to figure out or customize what I need to be productive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-it-s-going&#34;&gt;How it’s going&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m really glad that the vast majority of iOS can be navigated with just the keyboard (this has been true since iOS 9, but 10 refined it and 11 will go further). It’s actually a bit exceptional when I need to touch the screen, which is a little silly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn’t expecting this, but whatever friction remains between macOS and iOS is absent when I’m switching between my iPad and iPhone. It’s a qualitative observation, but the fact the apps are mostly identical means that I waste very little time context-switching between the two devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latest iPad Pro is the first to support quick-charging over USB-C. My original (2015) iPad Pro would barely tread water when connected to an 80W USB-C power brick, but the latest model’s battery charged from 7% to 57% in 90 minutes over USB-C, even under heavy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-i-wish-someone-told-me-about&#34;&gt;What I wish someone told me about&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought the LTE model and found that T-Mobile is currently offering a shockingly low &lt;strong&gt;$10 per month&lt;/strong&gt; unlimited data plan when adding a tablet line to a postpaid subscription (it also includes 2GB of tethering and unlimited 256kbps international data). It was too good a deal to pass up, and the liberation of not caring about finding wi-fi when I’m traveling is a huge stress relief&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://1blocker.com&#34;&gt;1Blocker&lt;/a&gt; to block ads, tracker scripts, and entire web sites where you’re prone to distract yourself. A dozen times a day I will try to access twitter-dot-com on my iPad only to have 1Blocker prevent me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I disallow notifications for almost every app (exceptions being Messages and FaceTime, at the moment). I don’t even let apps like Mail &amp;amp; Slack display badges icons, because the presence of a red badge while I’m switching apps with &lt;code&gt;⌘-Tab&lt;/code&gt; will stop me in my tracks and derail me from whatever I’m doing while I go and check it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few single-purpose utilities and extensions are indispensable to me, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mailtoself.com/info&#34;&gt;Mail to Self&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pipifier-pip-for-every-web-video/id1234771095?mt=8&#34;&gt;PiPifier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anyfont/id821560738?mt=8&#34;&gt;AnyFont&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deliveries-a-package-tracker/id290986013?mt=8&#34;&gt;Deliveries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many competent prose editors, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bear-writer.com&#34;&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/VviL8.i%29,&#34;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bywordapp.com&#34;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://omz-software.com/editorial/&#34;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; are my favorites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to automating iOS applications, &lt;a href=&#34;https://workflow.is&#34;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; can also invoke arbitrary scripts via SSH and then parse the results and do things with them. I’ve got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/searls/icloud-dotfiles/commit/8d97def58b17d390e25b496a4a5765ad863e6cd3&#34;&gt;near-fully automated CRM follow-up system in place now&lt;/a&gt; for the first time after years of complaining about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS 11 is going to be great, but I recommend holding off until it’s more stable if you’re planning to get anything done. While it adds a lot of gee-whiz “real work” features, a lot of the buzz is around touch gestures that don’t matter as much if you’re working primarily with a hardware keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_P1QuceqrpoFgZhjt759YA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;iPad Pro so clearly _needs a Keyboard accessory, Apple should consider rotating its logo 90º_&#34; /&gt;
iPad Pro so clearly &lt;em&gt;needs a Keyboard accessory, Apple should consider rotating its logo 90º&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-on-an-ipad&#34;&gt;Code! On an iPad!?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the iPad still doesn’t provide users any way to interface with the UNIX-ey bits under the hood, and any app that attempted to create such a shell would be rejected by Apple. The iPad Pro is more than capable of running ARM-based virtual machines, but there still isn’t any virtualization software available. Perhaps its 4GB of RAM would represent too low a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, from that perspective, no, you can’t code on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is what people have &lt;a href=&#34;http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad&#34;&gt;been trying&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later&#34;&gt;several years&lt;/a&gt;, which is connect to a remote device using a terminal app. While I could go full-cloud and spin up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linode.com/&#34;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Droplet&lt;/a&gt;, I’m fortunate to have an always-on iMac sitting at home that I can remote into, both on my LAN and (after setting up port forwarding on my home router) over the Internet. And with unlimited mobile data everywhere in the world, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t-mobile.com/offer/free-in-flight-wifi-texting-uncarrier.html&#34;&gt;even on planes&lt;/a&gt;, this constraint is less and less constraining than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’d tried to accomplish this workflow with &lt;a href=&#34;https://panic.com/prompt/&#34;&gt;Panic’s Prompt&lt;/a&gt;, but I found it unsuitable for “real” work. First, it only supports SSH, which doesn’t provide very durable connections — as soon as iOS suspends the Prompt instance to the background, its socket is closed and SSH needs to be reconnected. Additionally, Prompt doesn’t offer a way to re-bind an Escape key from any of the various escape-key-less MFi hardware keyboard cases or clamshells; this made terminal editors like Vim impossible to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then came &lt;a href=&#34;https://mosh.org&#34;&gt;mosh&lt;/a&gt;. Mosh has emerged as a competent alternative to SSH for this sort of thing, and its connections are much more durable. It communicates over UDP and in practice demonstrates incredibly low latency, too. I’m connecting to my iMac with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blink.sh&#34;&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; terminal, and it’s working better than Prompt ever did. Blink allows users to re-bind the caps-lock to escape and it’s no longer an issue when iOS kills the app in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UCvsvwcLJltOHTZ9FhK7Zg@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;Running a [testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js)’s unit test suite in a long-lived tmux session via Blink over mosh&#34; /&gt;
Running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js&#34;&gt;testdouble.js&lt;/a&gt;’s unit test suite in a long-lived tmux session via Blink over mosh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blink is hardly perfect, but since mosh is distributed under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License&#34;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;, it’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blinksh/blink&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; itself. At the end of the day, all I care about is that it can maintain a connection, send the right keystrokes, and then get out of my way, and the combination of Blink &amp;amp; mosh do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s really all there is to know about how I’m using the iPad for work all day. It’s a surprisingly complementary marriage of the focused simplicity of iOS combined with the powerful complexity of command-line Unix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;less-convenient-but-more-productive&#34;&gt;Less convenient, but more productive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, and now for the more introspective bits, as promised above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this experience, I realized that I don’t bother automating much on my Mac, because I know I can brute-force most activities without encountering &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much pain. If I can accomplish a task in 5 seconds by mashing &lt;code&gt;⌘-C ⌘-Tab ⌘-L ⌘-V&lt;/code&gt; to copy a URL and open it in my browser, I’ll (apparently) gladly repeat it dozens of times per day for 14 years without thinking to stop and find a way to reduce that friction further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience trying to do work on iPad has been much different. If I’m trying to do something ordinary (like opening a URL), iOS tends to be even lower-friction than macOS out-of-the-box, which I appreciate. But where working on the iPad really shines, ironically, is in how terrifically painful it is to perform out-of-the-ordinary actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say I need something a bit unusual, like saving web sites as PDFs into a specific folder and annotating them in a Markdown file. The dozens of taps demanded by such a task introduce so much friction that I was &lt;em&gt;compelled&lt;/em&gt; to automate it. It rarely occurs to me to automate anything in macOS, both because AppleScript/Automator pale in comparison to Workflow, but also because the macOS interface is &lt;em&gt;just good enough&lt;/em&gt; that no one instance of that action warrants investing the time into automating the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oBQmq2XbJncnjLu2Wd3nww.png&#34; alt=&#34;The aforementioned web-to-PDF action, implemented in [Workflow](http://workflow.is)The aforementioned web-to-PDF action, implemented in Workflow&#34; /&gt;
The aforementioned web-to-PDF action, implemented in &lt;a href=&#34;http://workflow.is&#34;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on why this is. Regardless of whether this phenomenon is by design, it certainly comports with Apple’s marketing ethos that the answer to every problem is “more apps”. If you’re trying to do something, and the only options available to you are high-friction, it’s as if iOS is screaming at you, “go find or create an app that does what you want!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, the locked-down, sandboxed nature of the first seven years of iOS releases put a bad taste in the mouths of most developers. For all the hype around apps from 2008 to 2013, a lot of what power users needed to be productive wasn’t possible within the constraints imposed by the operating system. In iOS, when some activity can’t be done elegantly, Apple has demonstrated a preference to ignore it completely than to risk half-assing it. This has served the majority of users far better than traditional desktop computers ever did, but they excluded people whose needs couldn’t yet be met under said constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s willingness to say “no”, even when it pushes power users away, couldn’t be more different than Microsoft’s post-iPhone-era strategy for Windows, which — at least since they killed off the similarly-useless-at-first-but-&lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/12/sinofsky-wwdc-2017&#34;&gt;nonetheless-courageous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT&#34;&gt;Windows RT&lt;/a&gt; — has been to tell users they can &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/2013/02/the_c_word&#34;&gt;have their cake and eat it too&lt;/a&gt;. But my experience of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/giving-windows-a-chance-39f4d7f1b93c&#34;&gt;spending a month&lt;/a&gt; trying to love the Surface Pro 4 showed me that Windows has ended up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/warm-takes-on-microsofts-surface-pro-4-580f77634d2c&#34;&gt;countless points of friction&lt;/a&gt;, occupying a sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/registering-a-microsoft-surface-pro-4-17c05d6d2e7a&#34;&gt;uncanny valley&lt;/a&gt; between traditional desktops and modern user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, most developers still believe the iPad to be a toy computer. The prevailing notion remains that the only sort of people who “work” on an iPad are business folks who while away their days in e-mail and spreadsheets. Apple spent eight years iterating on iOS before shipping the extension points necessary to accomplish the sort of actions demanded by its power users. Heck, it took nine major versions for real hardware keyboard support to materialize. The iPad may be old news, but its usefulness as a computer is still a recent development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with iOS 8, the number of well-considered and secure inter-application extension points in iOS has created a largely-yet-untapped opportunity for custom-tailored, friction-reducing integration and automation. In case you haven’t been keeping score, there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/&#34;&gt;scant little&lt;/a&gt; that can’t be accomplished with a combination of Actions, custom URL schemes, document providers, and (coming in iOS 11) drag-and-drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think of these features as mundane examples of how Apple is playing catch-up in iOS, since “real computers have always had them”, but the comparisons are only skin deep. For instance, consider desktop browser extensions: the browser gives developers some privileged utility methods, but otherwise the deal is, “write whatever JavaScript you want and screw around with the DOM however you like and please don’t scrape people’s passwords.” Compare that to the thought that Apple must have put into rigorously specifying the data &amp;amp; behavior contracts between apps found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imore.com/action-extensions-ios-8-explained&#34;&gt;Action extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort was foundational, because when extensions and apps are forced to produce metadata like what inputs and outputs they support, the operating system can later influence how users interact with them more intelligently. The reason that I find this exciting is because the constraints imposed by things like data type contracts — which some reasonably view as onerous — can facilitate creative automation elsewhere. It’s analogous to a dichotomy familiar to macOS apps, wherein a developer can use native UI controls (which benefit from greater OS-integration like VoiceOver and keyboard shortcuts) or can opt to build with web-based tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://electron.atom.io&#34;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, which are relatively unconstrained but — at least from the operating system’s perspective — impenetrable black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS 11 represents the culmination of years of essential groundwork and a gradual approach to reaching functional parity with the desktop in a formal, thoroughly reasoned-out way. And while I personally don’t care much about the new iPad “dock”, I definitely hope the excitement it’s generated will goose sales and make developers give the platform a second look. It’d be a shame for all those well-considered extension points to go unused, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-more-thing&#34;&gt;One more thing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from decreased productivity and increased distraction, another thing has changed about me since the iPhone released in 2007. I’m less kind and patient to others than I used to be. I’m generally more negative and cynical, too. I tend to be so drained at the end of each workday that it takes me a couple of hours just to unclench. I did not anticipate that switching from a Mac to an iPad would lead to marked improvement on those fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it sure seems to have helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been kinder, happier, and lower stress this month than I can recall in recent memory. Of course, I’ll need more data before I can reward a silly computer with that kind of testament. &lt;a href=&#34;http://testdouble.com&#34;&gt;Test Double&lt;/a&gt; also happens to be doing great recently, and I’m still feeling relief over having just given &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2017-05-11-how-to-program&#34;&gt;the best presentation of my professional life&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps I’m just riding that wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I can’t help but think there’s something deeper going on here. It’s clear that Apple has spent years laying the groundwork for iPad to &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; be a competent replacement to a desktop OS, even for a developer like me. What wasn’t clear until now was that the iPad might suddenly leapfrog beyond “just good enough” and start radically improve the lives experience of work itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not bad for an oversized iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In seven days, it will have been ten years since the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone.html&#34;&gt;keynote to end all keynotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade hence, I’m uncomfortable with declarations that the iPhone and iOS are “mature,” however. Unlike other mature platforms that became commoditized and absorbed into daily life, smartphones have not receded into the periphery of our attention. If anything, the entire planet is more glued to their phones today than ever before. “Mature” is code for “set in stone”, and it’s my view that any device that’s able to so thoroughly capture the attention of the human race as the iPhone-era smartphone demands continuous reinvestment. Past decisions should be constantly reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after a year like 2016, I like to hope that Apple is reconsidering some of the decisions they’ve made about how their platforms have influenced life on earth, including our politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Apple chooses to market iOS 11 will show us how they see their platform. If they agree that iOS is “mature”, then we should expect a release focused on mere quality-of-life improvements. If they see iOS as the highly-influenctial, culturally significant touchpoint it has become, they might make fundamental changes that shake up how we use (and others exploit) their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will share one potential direction Apple might take its platforms in these uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-started-with-privacy&#34;&gt;It started with privacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple’s executives began &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11102870/Apple-goes-public-on-privacy-policy.html&#34;&gt;making a public case&lt;/a&gt; for prioritizing user privacy and security, their software platforms became overtly political. In the United States, there is no way to avoid politics when advocating for or against an individual’s right to privacy. And anyone familiar with encryption technology was not at-all-surprised by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/fbi-apple/&#34;&gt;fracas&lt;/a&gt; that unfolded in response to Apple’s unwillingness (or, had the device been newer than an iPhone 5c, inability) to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/&#34;&gt;create a backdoor&lt;/a&gt; for the government to retrieve data from a customer’s device—even though the customer had committed an act of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many critics of Apple’s stance on privacy have said theirs is a high-horse of convenience: Apple makes their money selling tangible products to customers, and their financial success is not impeded when they deny themselves information about who its users are and how they live their lives. That Apple’s circumstance is (however bizarrely) rare in the technology world is used as evidence that it is uncompetitive or unfair for Apple to seize upon the opportunity to build an inherently private platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gets missed in all this is that every company gets to choose how it makes its money. Apple has continuously reaffirmed its choice to make money by selling products (and more recently, services) directly to its customers. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and most other startups, initially chose to make their money by selling equity to investors, valued by the popularity of their unpaid services. This exit strategy maneuver has eventually backed each service into the same corner: the only way to appease investors is to turn a profit, but when all you have is popularity, the only available business strategies require you to sell out your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This crisis of “how do businesses make money” is not a drama unfolding among the gods on Mount Olympus. It’s a choice we all make, even if we don’t realize it. For instance, years ago, I learned that I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2016-12-01-a-creativity-talk.html&#34;&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/5-Day-Training-Agenda&#34;&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt;, and writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. I could have chosen to put my screencasts behind a paywall or charge a speaker’s fee, but I wanted to be incentivized to share what I created freely with everyone. That’s what led me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://testdouble.com/agency&#34;&gt;consulting&lt;/a&gt;—my freely available creative work can serve as both a public good and as a loss-leader for marketing our team’s consulting services. If I had naively decided to simply charge others for doing what I loved, I’d have reached a much smaller audience, comprised of people who probably already agree with me. That was just one intentional choice of many; that every new company must find a billion unpaid users to be considered successful is not a &lt;a href=&#34;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider&#34;&gt;foregone conclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should applaud Apple’s old-fashioned-yet-exceptional business model of “charge people money for things,” because it has enabled them to take a bold stand on behalf of our own privacy &amp;amp; security. But stop and ask yourself: what else could the owners of iOS (and macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) do for the good of humanity with the profound freedom-of-movement their business model affords them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one answer: challenge the ubiquitous belief that access to information is an unambiguous good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;infinite-information-and-the-finite-mind&#34;&gt;Infinite information and the finite mind&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the iPhone was first unveiled, it offered people a chance to hold all of the world’s information in their hands. For the first time, humans could be connected to the sum of all knowledge everywhere they went and at every moment of the day. This represented unambiguous progress at the time. From the invention of the printing press to the release of the iPhone, we saw ourselves as within grasp of completing our march to the Enlightenment’s promised land: unfettered, instantaneous availability of all the world’s information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the iPhone, our ideology had framed information in terms of its scarcity or availability. Scarce information was a tool of oppressive fascism, whereas freely-available information was a hallmark of liberty. But more recently, we’ve started to realize what happens when infinite information comes into contact with the finite human mind: somebody else gets to sort it. Whether it’s Google’s search, Facebook’s Newsfeed algorithms, or our own self-made echo chambers on Twitter, the sampling of the Internet’s infinite information that each of us receive is at best arbitrary and at worst manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually think Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes was right when she claimed that there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/videos/a51152/trump-surrogate-no-such-thing-as-facts/&#34;&gt;no such thing as facts&lt;/a&gt;. Not anymore. In an era when anyone can confirm their bias by bringing their own sources to the table, facts themselves have lost whatever authority they once had in discourse and debate. It could be decades before the authority of education, science, and facts are restored in society, and we need to start planning for life after the death of the concept of “public trust.” And until facts regain their power to settle arguments, technology companies should pause before assuming that more information is inherently better than less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for technology companies, they’ve spent the last 15 years building an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/youre-not-googles-custome_b_841599.html&#34;&gt;economy designed to maximize our attention to information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;engagement-considered-harmful&#34;&gt;Engagement considered harmful&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump won the election because an increasing share of our economy is optimized for maximizing user &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt;, and Trump exploited its blindspots to literally unbelievable success. He received near-constant attention in liberal and conservative corners of the media alike. He made me pull-to-refresh my Twitter timeline so frequently that my thumb often hurt at the end of the day. And whenever the zeitgeist naturally began to drift to other topics, Trump had the uncanny ability to say something just provocative enough to regain the world’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,” &lt;a href=&#34;http://fortune.com/2016/03/01/les-moonves-cbs-trump/&#34;&gt;said CBS chief&lt;/a&gt;, Les Moonves. He was criticized for the quote, but it could have applied to any engagement-driven business, from the Washington Post to Facebook. In the short-term at least, Trump-the-engagement-phenomenon has represented, for Google and CNN alike, a tremendous windfall in marketing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed Trump’s ascension, a lot of attention was paid to &lt;a href=&#34;http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election/&#34;&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook as a contributing factor. Fake stories were not only peddled by white supremacists, but also by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.by4KWd5QA#.nlw5gOK49&#34;&gt;entrepreneurial outrage manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; throughout the campaign. The spread of this news was not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the fault of Facebook’s faceless engagement-optimizing Newsfeed algorithm, but also by many Americans who feel genuine &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/12/12/13894546/obama-race-black-white-house-cornell-belcher-racism&#34;&gt;racial antipathy&lt;/a&gt;. The popular solution—remove fake news from people’s feeds—suggests that correcting or hiding false information will somehow result in a better-informed citizenry. This approach is doomed to fail, however, because it doesn’t take the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect&#34;&gt;Streisand effect&lt;/a&gt; into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What media companies and marketing platforms alike don’t want to allow for is the possibility that inaccurate information isn’t the enemy, &lt;em&gt;information addiction&lt;/em&gt; is. Rather, I propose that &lt;strong&gt;systems which attempt to maximize our consumption of information are the true cause for Trump’s success&lt;/strong&gt;. No one should be surprised to learn that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gsood.com/research/papers/BroadbandPolarization.pdf&#34;&gt;researchers found a correlation&lt;/a&gt; between the proliferation of broadband Internet and a rise in political polarization. In an engagement-driven economy, dispassionate objective reality doesn’t sell, polarizing outrage does. And it’s a vicious cycle—as users acclimate to outrageous information, they’ll set forth on their own, looking for stronger and stronger doses. Fox News gave way to The Daily Caller gave way to Breitbart gave way to Info Wars gave way to Stormfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[To his credit, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sullivan&#34;&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; predicted this pattern of polarization years ago with what he dubbed &lt;a href=&#34;http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/?s=epistemic+closure&#34;&gt;epistemic closure&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of a limiting factor on polarization in an era of infinitely spreadable and accessible information.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But infiniteness and openness may not be as inherent to how we experience the Internet as we once believed. If anything, the recent success of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform&#34;&gt;walled gardens&lt;/a&gt; over open protocols has proven that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2017/01/year-donald-trump-kills-net-neutrality/&#34;&gt;openness doesn’t necessarily win&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways, we’re now at the mercy of a handful of garden owner-operators anyway, so we may as well demand that they design their gardens well. The platform-holders, like Apple, can do more than occasionally weed things out, they can determine what sort of plants are allowed to grow in the first place. This level of corporate control and influence is a frightening thing to think about, but better to debate it in the open than to be left in the dark, as we have in the cases of Facebook’s Newsfeed and Google’s search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ios-11-the-un-engager&#34;&gt;iOS 11: The Un-engager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a roundabout way, Apple’s success at popularizing always-on, always-connected devices has led us to this point. Regardless of whether that makes them responsible for its effects, it does suggest they may have the power to start stuffing the genie back into the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’ve all become information addicts, perhaps Apple could build into its platforms a means to start treating ourselves. If it works, Apple would be rewarded with greater customer satisfaction and, one presumes, device sales. And it would be a differentiator that Google and many others would be unlikely to ever full-throatedly imitate, since giving users greater control would stand in direct conflict to the motives of engagement-maximizing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas of things Apple could do to combat engagement abuse, many of which could pass under the guise of strengthening user privacy by way of undermining unsolicited marketing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apps and services designed to help people ration their own information consumption like &lt;a href=&#34;https://inthemoment.io&#34;&gt;Moment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom.to/&#34;&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://heyfocus.com&#34;&gt;Focus&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more popular, but are hamstrung by iOS platform limitations. Apple could leverage its role as platform-owner to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sherlocked&#34;&gt;sherlock&lt;/a&gt; all of these services with a simple preference pane that enables users to limit how much time they spend on certain sites and apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS could build-in a sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber&#34;&gt;Skinner box detection&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to arming self-aware users with the tools to monitor or restrict their access to sites and apps they tend to “over-engage” with, Apple could develop heuristics that help users identify information addiction in the first place. For example, if an app makes the same API request dozens of times an hour, iOS might suggest enabling controls to remind or limit oneself from repeatedly getting sucked into refreshing that app’s news feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS 6’s introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321&#34;&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/a&gt; gave users a blunt defense from the ever-increasing deluge of notifications being sent to iOS devices, but it casts far too wide a net to be reasonable for most people to leave Do Not Disturb enabled 24/7. What if iOS 11 raised the floor on when users were disturbed by learning to label and filter out “low-priority” and “junk” notifications &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202315&#34;&gt;just like Mail did&lt;/a&gt;? In a similar vein, what if iOS offered users a way to batch all of their notifications at set time intervals, to prevent the constant distraction of taps and banners and buzzes? I have to imagine I’m not alone in responding to pointless notifications with the foolish ritual of also opening Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram for a fresh hit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/feeding-the-addiction.aspx&#34;&gt;Like&lt;/a&gt; until I come to my senses and realize that 20 minutes have elapsed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intention-based unlocking: a dozen times a day I pick up my phone to perform an action, but get distracted by the siren songs of engagement-driven social media apps instead—only to forget why I picked up the phone to begin with! What if the new stickier lock screen introduced in iOS 10 could enable users to register &lt;em&gt;their intent&lt;/em&gt; such that iOS could then help them stick to it? Maybe this would look like a more-prominently-located-than-notifications widget of user-initiated activities (e.g. set a reminder, take a note, etc.). Maybe it could be as simple as Siri shortcuts to sandboxed experiences; telling Siri “I want to write a tweet” might open a keyboard-driven tweet composer that spares the user from ever seeing their own timeline, for instance. The building blocks for this already exist with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-interactive-notifications-on-ios-10/&#34;&gt;interactive notifications&lt;/a&gt; introduced in iOS 10, the key difference being that actions could be user-initiated instead of reactions to notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple could regulate its App Store marketplace by dictating monthly and lifetime spend limits on in-app purchases in an effort to eliminate the abusive &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/&#34;&gt;whale-based economics of mobile gaming&lt;/a&gt;. This would affect Apple’s bottom-line in the short run, but (aside from protecting a small class of high-spending IAP users) the catastrophic impact such an action would have on the free-to-play game industry would have the added benefit of dramatically improving &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38365559&#34;&gt;the health&lt;/a&gt; of the overall app ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS 11 could expand on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackingwithswift.com/safari-content-blocking-ios9-install&#34;&gt;iOS 9 Content Blocker API&lt;/a&gt; to include a means for inspecting the content displayed to a user and alerting them about it. Beyond being a simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/heres-a-browser-extension-that-will-flag-fake-news-sites.html&#34;&gt;fake news-detecting browser extension&lt;/a&gt;, Apple could wedge in the ability for such extensions to access native user interface elements within apps like Facebook and Twitter themselves. If designed carefully, creative extensions could be designed to report conflicts-of-interest, flag &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising&#34;&gt;native advertising&lt;/a&gt;, and promote opposing viewpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple could leverage the fact that theirs is the only browser in town to start an anti-analytics arms race. After years of Google &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pays-17m-to-settle-safari-cookie-privacy-bypass-charge/&#34;&gt;circumventing cookie controls&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseackerman/2013/02/27/big-internet-companies-struggle-over-proper-response-to-consumers-do-not-track-requests/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;do-not-track headers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://smallbiztrends.com/2015/12/doubleclick-native-ads-defeat-ad-blockers.html&#34;&gt;defeating ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple could begin fighting back on behalf of users more aggressively. What if iOS automatically subscribed to Apple-maintained blacklists of servers that capture user analytics? Or, what if their JavaScript engine was designed to block attempts to work around a browser’s privacy features? What if Apple took the extreme step of preventing apps from being able to phone home to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/admob/&#34;&gt;admob&lt;/a&gt; at all? All of these approaches seem simultaneously technically feasible and potentially calamitous to companies that make their money off reselling user data without explicit consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the web, Apple’s mail clients could ship preconfigured not to load images from untrusted senders. Magic pixel images have turned e-mail into a marketing platform driven by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_rate&#34;&gt;open rates&lt;/a&gt; and a surprising array of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking&#34;&gt;analytics&lt;/a&gt; about recipients, and with an action as simple as blocking images by default, Apple could unilaterally put the sleaziest of e-mail marketing companies out of business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-mail also remains a huge vector for those who would attack an individual’s privacy. Many have claimed this is because e-mail was designed for an earlier era, or that the fact that no one “owns” e-mail means that fundamental improvements (like encryption) can’t be made. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy&#34;&gt;Hogwash&lt;/a&gt;. Apple could use the same technology that enables iMessage users to detect one another as a mechanism for encrypting e-mail by default. First, Apple would quietly generate a PGP key-pair, store it in each user’s encrypted keychain, and then invisibly distribute users’ public GPG keys to any e-mail address that’s also registered with iMessage. Apple’s own mail clients, in turn, would encrypt and decrypt e-mail with as little fanfare as iMessage’s iconic blue bubbles. Third-party mail clients on Apple’s devices would be pushed to get on board, as encrypted e-mail would spread virally—just like iMessage itself did. The public conversation would then shift to Google (who reads users’ e-mail to tailor its marketing) and other mail providers: why aren’t you encrypting your users’ email by default, as well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just the first ideas that popped into my head when given the prompt “what if we stopped believing that more information was always good?” I have to imagine there are much better ideas out there. Unfortunately, Apple (along with perhaps Microsoft) may be the only platform holders with both the power and incentive to do anything about the toxic effect engagement-driven economy has had on us and our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lack of many alternatives, here’s to hoping that Apple agrees that iOS is not-quite-yet a mature platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-some-background&#34;&gt;First, some background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I embarked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/giving-windows-a-chance-39f4d7f1b93c#.vco2pxs3r&#34;&gt;spiritual journey&lt;/a&gt; this week to answer these questions: do all the developers I see switching (or threatening to switch) to Windows see something that I don’t? Has Microsoft actually turned the Windows user experience around? Is the combination of Microsoft’s hardware &amp;amp; software superior to Apple’s on the Mac?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of these questions: hope. Hope that people have placed in Microsoft’s embrace of open source, its in-house hardware design, and its broadened cross-platform support. My suspicion at the outset of this experiment was that the recent, near-universal praise of Windows is, instead, mostly hype—fueled in large part by a general frustration that Apple has been the only serious contender for developer mindshare for over a decade. Most of the people I know switching to Windows of-late are furious about Apple’s apparent product direction, and I’m biased to think their praise of Windows represents a sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning&#34;&gt;motivated reasoning&lt;/a&gt;. But I can’t test my bias without seeing Windows appraised by someone who, like me, is a genuine fan of Apple’s products… reluctantly, I figured I’d do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last week, I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-4/productID.5072641000&#34;&gt;Surface Pro 4&lt;/a&gt; from the local &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/oh/columbus/easton-town-center/store-1106&#34;&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and put it through its paces on my own terms and carrying my own biases. I’m not a dispassionate reviewer, poring over each feature checkbox and assessing its objective quality. I’m just someone who really likes using iOS and macOS, but is interested in challenging Microsoft’s products by asking them to “make me switch.” These are my initial notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent over twenty hours documenting my observations as I compare the Surface to the Mac, including some of the things that macOS can’t do (things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/registering-a-microsoft-surface-pro-4-17c05d6d2e7a#.a2abazl3s&#34;&gt;registering the serial number&lt;/a&gt; to obtain warranty support). This post will focus on my experience as a new user. In a subsequent post, I’ll cover development environment setup for Ruby &amp;amp; JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very long and very painful read. So gird yourself and pour a stiff drink now. Go ahead, I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-a-dying-document&#34;&gt;This is a dying document&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to say things in this document that are uninformed, inaccurate, and unfair. This is a very spritely-edited list of snap observations I made while getting used to Windows 10 and my Surface, categorized only for digestibility by you, the reader. As a result, &lt;strong&gt;please feel free to add comments&lt;/strong&gt; wherever I goofed up or where you know a workaround to a problem I encountered. I’ll do my best to curate your comments so that subsequent readers will see them, but I will avoid the temptation to continuously edit the document itself to correct the record, as any fixes wouldn’t be true to my real (if fallible) experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up: what it was like to buy the Surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-purchasing-experience&#34;&gt;The Purchasing Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the Easton Microsoft Store with next-to-no knowledge of Microsoft’s current hardware offerings. When it comes to consumer technology, it’s rare that I’m operating at an information deficit relative to the staff, so I reveled in the opportunity to learn about the Surface &amp;amp; Surface Book from Microsoft’s own employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without exception, the staff was friendly and kind. Nobody was pushy, but at the same time they were very pleased to see that I was interested in buying something. I got the sense that everyone was very well trained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over my two visits, the staff was able to help me make heads or tails of how the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-4/productID.5072641000&#34;&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; compares to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-book/overview&#34;&gt;Surface Book&lt;/a&gt;, initially guiding my decision to buy the $799 Surface Pro since the cheapest Surface Book with a dedicated GPU (the only reason I’d want one) was twice the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The store was clean, uncluttered, and mostly well-laid-out. People gave Microsoft a lot of grief for aping the design of the Apple Store, but I think the retail industry would be a lot better off if &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; company ripped off Apple’s stores and that we should welcome the imitation of pleasant experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a product that’s priced at or above the iPad Pro, I was genuinely surprised that not a single configuration includes any kind of mobile/cellular radio. Later, I learned that the previous edition, the Surface Pro 3, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.windowscentral.com/why-ill-be-swapping-surface-pro-3-surface-3-lte&#34;&gt;offered an LTE model&lt;/a&gt;, but this year’s didn’t. What?! And you all thought &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+iphone+courage+meme&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;biw=1053&amp;amp;bih=656&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrjIPt4ZTRAhULyoMKHUBKClAQsAQIIA&#34;&gt;Apple had #courage&lt;/a&gt;! There’d be riots if Apple did this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used Apple Pay at checkout and didn’t get any grief about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was given this hilariously &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BOYXzaIDKB6&#34;&gt;large and durable tote bag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, it turns out that I made a partially uninformed purchase. The next day, I dropped by the store on my way home and mentioned what I’d just purchased to a representative. He kindly informed me that while I had paid $930 for a 4GB/128GB i5 Surface and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pro-4-Type-Cover/productID.325723100&#34;&gt;Type Cover&lt;/a&gt;, there was a special promotion for an 8GB/256GB i5 Surface that included the Type Cover for $999. He was apologetic they hadn’t mentioned it the night before and processed an exchange, even though I didn’t have the box or power supply with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who hates buying things from corporeal humans, I found the process of buying the Surface to be genuinely enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-unboxing-experience&#34;&gt;The Unboxing Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened and set up the device from my hotel room, and I paid close attention to the package design and initial shipping conditions of the product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tape used on the box features friendly-looking pull tabs, but was actually very difficult for me to pry off with my bare hands—what a tease!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The box itself was unexceptional and the product was mostly unadorned, minimalist to an almost Apple extent (I say almost because the plastic wrap around the surface had printed bullet points of hardware features on it, as if that was the best place to teach me about what I could use the Surface for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Surface and Pen were displayed prominently in the box, but the power supply was hidden off to the side, itself in a cheap white cardboard box of its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the power supply, there’s a reason the package designer tried to hide it: the thing is grotesquely huge. Microsoft had to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.5074014400&#34;&gt;crop its product photo&lt;/a&gt; on its online store. This thing takes up more space in my bag than my 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro’s 100W power supply. If Apple had shipped this, people would complain that the power supply includes a USB port, as if that exacerbated the size. In reality, I suspect the port was tacked on &lt;em&gt;as a result&lt;/em&gt; of the power supply’s girth and was not a contributing factor to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both of my Surface Pro devices shipped with &lt;strong&gt;completely dead&lt;/strong&gt; batteries. Apple products usually ship with a 50–75% charge so you can start using them right away, but each Surface was a brick until I plugged it in for a minute or two. Perhaps this is the result of Apple &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2023116&#34;&gt;turning over its inventory every week&lt;/a&gt; and the Surface sitting on shelves for weeks, but regardless, it’s a suboptimal user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Surface Pro 4 ships with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pen/productID.325724000&#34;&gt;Pen&lt;/a&gt; accessory, but it doesn’t come paired. I suspect if Apple shipped its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/&#34;&gt;Pencil&lt;/a&gt; with the iPad Pro, it would come paired out-of-the-box (like the Apple TV’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLLC2LL/A/siri-remote&#34;&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pen comes preloaded with a teeny-tiny &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA_battery&#34;&gt;AAAA battery&lt;/a&gt;, a form factor I didn’t previously know existed and which I simply cannot wait to replace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to magnetically stick the Pen to the left side of the Surface is a welcome change of pace, as I never know where my Apple Pencil is unless I awkwardly stick it in my pocket as I move about the house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC01748.jpg&#34;&gt;Surface kickstand&lt;/a&gt; is inelegant and feels cheap, but it’s functionally superior to Apple’s smart cover in that it can be adjusted to arbitrary angles and (unlike my 12&amp;quot; iPad Pro) isn’t prone to frequently falling off and causing the device to crash to the table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tablet and pen themselves look and feel cheap and bulky. The pen’s cap, grip, and tip all look ugly with their gray-on-gray two-tone rubber, which itself sports an unpleasant gritty texture. The Surface itself looks good from the front and the back, but everything along the sides feels cheap, especially where it reverts to plastic or has holes exposed for the built-in fan and ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pro-4-Type-Cover/productID.325723100&#34;&gt;Type Cover&lt;/a&gt;’s keys feel good with a surprising amount of travel for its height, but the trackpad seems too small. The Cover’s pseudo-cloth texture which covers the palm rests is layered atop the hard plastic awkwardly and is deeply unpleasant to the touch. I will say, though, that the magnetic click the Type Cover makes as it snaps into the base unit is very satisfying and consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unboxing experience and my initial impressions of the hardware were positive… if I grade it on a curve. I would have been appalled at numerous points if this had been an Apple product, but I had (appropriately) low expectations. Verdict: “this seems way, way better than opening a new Dell or HP device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-user-on-boarding&#34;&gt;Initial User On-boarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any modern device, there’s a wizard that helps get the machine initially configured (a network configured, an initial user account created, etc.). My thoughts on my first moments with the Surface software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1: connect to a wireless network. I selected my hotel’s wi-fi network and, instead of rendering Hilton’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal&#34;&gt;captive page&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard hung for a few moments and timed out. I hunted frantically for a “skip” button and didn’t find one. Worried that a Surface couldn’t be used without connecting to Microsoft’s servers, I clicked “back” and found a link to proceed offline in small font under the network list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over two pages and five checkboxes, Microsoft asks for the user’s consent for tracking their data. I found it refreshing that they separated the option for data to be used for advertising from data needed for more critical functionality, but I was still alarmed by the catch-all default set to share all my “browsing data” for the mere purpose of predictive page loading. Yikes. (Against my better judgment, I left all of these checked because I’m trying to evaluate the default, recommended experience.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wizard had me pair the Surface Pen and took a moment to explain a few of the buttons for me; that brief tutorial was probably the highlight of the wizard experience, as I wouldn’t have known the eraser could register clicks and double-clicks otherwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wizard had me create a user account and, since I was offline, it was a completely local username and password and not tied to my Microsoft account. Later, I would download an app from the Windows Store which required me to login to my Microsoft account and then— without prior warning — Windows changed how I login to my entire computer so that my password would match my Microsoft credentials. I promptly forgot about this and found myself temporarily locked out of my computer the next time it restarted, because my Microsoft password was generated by 1Password and I don’t have it memorized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I’d completed the wizard — entirely offline — the Surface displayed a full-screen “Making everything ready for you” message and spent over a minute doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, but who knows what. Honestly, what could the device be possibly doing that takes so much time if it’s not sending or receiving any data on a network? I’m genuinely curious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as the wizard launched me into the Windows desktop, the screen was much too dim for my tastes, so I started tapping the apparent brightness buttons on the Type Cover over the F1 and F2 keys, only to find that they had no effect. I later came to realize that those keys merely control the brightness of the Type Cover’s &lt;em&gt;keycaps’&lt;/em&gt; LEDs. Why would Microsoft devote two physical keys to keycap brightness (something I’ll set once and never think of again) while leaving control of the much more important display brightness unbound?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from the pen, the wizard seemed like a missed opportunity to teach me much about how to use the Surface. I’m always a fan of jumping right into an environment and playing around, but not everyone is going to have the initiative to find and download the &lt;a href=&#34;http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/9/B/29B20383-302C-4517-A006-B0186F04BE28/surface-pro-4-user-guide-EN.pdf&#34;&gt;User Guide PDF&lt;/a&gt; like I did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one last feature that I only bothered to set up on my second Surface device: &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17215/windows-10-what-is-hello&#34;&gt;Windows Hello&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nifty login mechanism that has the user configure a numeric PIN (so now I have configured a local password, a Microsoft account password, and a PIN with which to unlock my device) as well as pose for a facial recognition system that’s akin to the one found on the now-mostly-defunct &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect&#34;&gt;Xbox Kinect&lt;/a&gt;. The facial detection almost always recognizes me, but I have no clue whether it would recognize &lt;em&gt;only me&lt;/em&gt;, or if it’s just on the look out for bemused and balding generic white men. A separate security concern is that, unlike Apple’s Touch ID, Windows Hello doesn’t seem to be primed by a secure password entry—rebooting the device will still allow facial recognition to initially log a user in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing missing from the wizard: any mention of full-disk encryption. iOS devices are always encrypted and new Mac devices encourage users to enable FileVault during their set-up wizard, but I had to dig a little to understand what the Surface had done. I was pleased to discover that the Surface Pro 4 had Microsoft’s full-disk BitLocker encryption enabled by default (even if it can be defeated by a rando wearing a Justin Searls mask)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;typing-and-swiping&#34;&gt;Typing and Swiping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak for you, but I spend a lot of my time on computers typing on keyboards and swiping on trackpads. One of the things that pushed me away from Windows in 2004 was the slowly-increasing input lag associated with keystrokes and clicks throughout the user interface. The distraction caused by waiting around for the GUI to catch up with my keystrokes or clicks would often pull me out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29&#34;&gt;productive flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts on the keys and trackpad on the Surface Pro 4&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pro-4-Type-Cover/productID.325723100&#34;&gt;Type Cover&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately at $129):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas the MacBook’s Force Trackpad features palm rejection (a necessary improvement given how massive the trackpad is), the comparatively small Type Cover trackpad instead seems to feature a “dead zone”. That is, if you place a finger on the trackpad and move it less than a millimeter, the input is ignored. If you drag your finger further, Windows will start registering cursor movement. I find this compromise — probably implemented in the spirit of reducing accidental input — really frustrating, as the tiny trackpad doesn’t have many millimeters to spare. Worse, this dead zone implementation often prevents intentional swipes from &lt;em&gt;ever registering at all&lt;/em&gt;, even when I rub a finger over the entire width of the trackpad. My brain’s very first thought every single time I touch its primary interface is “oh shit, the computer isn’t working”, and this experience is repeated hundreds of times per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trackpad’s height is incredible short, and that makes for very limited space for two-finger scrolling gestures. This means it was even more important for Microsoft to nail the acceleration curve to ensure a pleasant scrolling experience. Sadly, swipe-scrolling on the Type Cover’s trackpad is far too slow and it doesn’t accelerate nearly quickly enough to work through a document quickly. Just scrolling from this point of the article back to the top of the page required me to lift my fingers &lt;strong&gt;14 times&lt;/strong&gt; on my Surface trackpad. For comparison, it only took a single swipe on my MacBook Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS and macOS are really good at locking the horizontal scroll of a window in place when it suspects that a user is scrolling up-and-down, and Windows attempts to do the same but it does a poor job of it. I experienced accidental side-to-side scroll (which in turn tended to interrupt any intentional vertical scroll) on roughly one out of every six swipes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One surprising aspect of the trackpad is that it features, by default, the much-derided inverted “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/mac-os-x-lion-natural-scrolling-2011-7&#34;&gt;natural scrolling&lt;/a&gt;” first featured by Mac OS X Lion. I like this both because I’m already accustomed to it and because it would be pretty jarring to swipe in one direction on the touchscreen and in the opposite direction on the trackpad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another aspect I miss from the Force Trackpad is its ability to offer the same satisfying click along the top as the bottom; alas, the type cover’s trackpad implements an older “diving board” click mechanism which makes it easier to click from the bottom than the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite features of Mac OS X Leopard was the ability to scroll inactive windows in the background without first bringing them into focus. Windows, of course, also allows this, but I found on numerous occasions that scroll events on inactive windows weren’t registering as reliably as active ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of scrolling, at one point, my Surface’s touch screen stopped responding to &lt;em&gt;all touch input whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;. I spent twenty minutes searching for a solution (figuring that I just disabled the touch screen through a configuration setting) before giving up and restarting the computer. To my surprise, this restart triggered an unskippable Windows Update and which took over 8 minutes to install. The restart did, however unsatisfyingly, fix the touchscreen failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I noticed that with a dozen or so tabs open, the 4GB/128GB i5 Surface started to really slow down in its ability to respond to my keystrokes, and I was able to detect very noticeable input lag as I typed. This sort of thing is simply unacceptable with 2016 hardware, especially because Windows 2000 handled keyboard input under heavy load on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III&#34;&gt;Pentium III&lt;/a&gt; much more ably than this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no way to type emoji with the hardware keyboard, whereas Apple ships a fantastic emoji picker in macOS (it can be invoked by cmd-ctrl-space)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no apparent way to type non-ASCII characters without a numpad, which the Surface obviously lacks. I asked about this and a bunch of folks told me I could type things like an ® with the “shortcut” of Alt-0174, until they realized I didn’t have a numpad, in which case they told me to use the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Map_%28Windows%29&#34;&gt;Character Map&lt;/a&gt;” app, which looks like it hasn’t been improved since I first used it in Windows 95. Many of these common glyphs and diacritics have easy shortcuts in macOS, meanwhile (alt-R for ®, for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most surprisngly, the function (“Fn”) key toggles state in a manner similar to a Caps lock key. It even has a little LED light to indicate state. I suppose this is a feature built for people who make ample use of the F1-F12 keys, but it’s frankly confusing for anyone who needs the Fn key primarily for the keyboard shortcuts which require you to simultaneously depress it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the experience of typing and scrolling in Windows is every bit as awful as I remember it. There’s simply no excuse for input lag on keystrokes or scrolling that feels so unnatural. These are the most fundamental user interactions in the entire operating system, performed by users thousands of times per day. They warrant a level of care and attention that Microsoft has repeatedly failed to give. This was excusable when Microsoft could blame the hardware vendor, but the buck stops with them now that they own the product from top-to-bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle to imagine how anyone can find this experience to be acceptable, but understand that everyone’s threshold for perceiving the “natural-ness” of a UI control varies greatly. (For comparison, some gamers can easily detect when games fail to render 60 frames per second, whereas I can’t tell a bad framerate from a good one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that if I ran Microsoft, I would stop development on every feature of every application until my platform could ensure that typing and scrolling were &lt;em&gt;thoroughly delightful and convincing.&lt;/em&gt; They are currently neither. This is easily the defining failure of Microsoft’s foray into hardware. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=you+had+one+job&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ3-X32pXRAhUC7YMKHUkEAnkQ_AUICCgB&amp;amp;biw=1053&amp;amp;bih=656&#34;&gt;You had one job&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-tablet-and-a-computer&#34;&gt;A tablet AND a computer!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s most aggressive sales pitch for the Surface — and maybe for Windows 10 as a whole — has been its ability to operate as both a desktop and touch-screen tablet, as well as everything in-between. Microsoft’s marketing claimed that touchscreen desktops represent a “&lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/compromise&#34;&gt;no compromise&lt;/a&gt;” design. Apple executives, meanwhile, have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-macbook-pro-new-philip-schiller-interview-phil-iphone-ios-criticism-a7393156.html&#34;&gt;held firm&lt;/a&gt; that a device trying to be both things will wind up compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have a dog in this fight; I don’t feel like macOS is missing out for want of a touch screen, but at the same time it’s hilarious to watch kids tap hopelessly on a Mac and conclude that it must be broken. Here’s what I noticed about the “tablet-ey” aspects of the Surface, knowing I didn’t really seek them out and don’t care much when they fall over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I disconnected the Type Cover, Windows asked if I wanted to enable &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17210/windows-10-use-your-pc-like-a-tablet&#34;&gt;tablet mode&lt;/a&gt;. It delights me every time I see this and I can’t explain why. I personally prefer the tablet mode, even when using the device as a laptop, if only because on a small screen I find that I’d usually rather give my current app full-screen focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In tablet mode, a swipe from the left side of the screen will bring up an alt-tab like window switcher. This is quick and useful, but takes some getting used to if you’re coming from iOS or Android and expecting left-edge-swipes to serve as a “back” gesture for navigating the UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A swipe from the right side of the screen will show the generically-named “Action Center”, which serves as a combination of the iOS/macOS notification center and the iOS control center. Action Center generally serves its purpose, but for some reason in tablet mode, it’s really hard for me to dismiss items with any accuracy. An “X” is not displayed next to a notification until I touch it, but when I move my finger to tap it, the X often disappears and I instead activate the notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On three occasions I’ve woken the Surface from sleep and the screen has stopped registering touch input until I restart the device. The fact that Microsoft can’t get such a basic thing nailed down by their fourth at-bat gives me serious pause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to find a file while I was in tablet mode, and I couldn’t figure out how to launch File Explorer by any means other than typing in a search for the word “File”. File Explorer and the Desktop are mostly hidden from you when in tablet mode. It’s one thing that iOS doesn’t expose a hierarchical file system to the user, and it’s worth debating the merits of that decision, but it’s quite another for Windows to pretend that the user need not worry about files and folders when sitting in a recliner. Like it or hate it, files remain the primary abstraction for organizing a user’s data in Windows, and changing from a trackpad to a finger doesn’t fundamentally alter that fact. This is the very definition of a compromised design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I was setting up Windows Mail, I noticed a setting that indicated you could swipe to archive e-mail (similar to Mail.app for iOS or macOS). I tried this a dozen times on the trackpad before realizing the swipe gesture only works on the touchscreen. The impedance mismatch of gestures that work on only one of the touchscreen or trackpad is pretty discouraging. Ideally, the trackpad should be able to register any gesture as the touchscreen on the presumption that the cursor’s current location would stand-in for a finger’s location on the touch screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As one might expect, a lot of the tap targets — particularly links in web sites — are way too small for even my relatively-dainty-for-a-man fingertips. I think the root cause here is that almost all web sites render as “desktop” pages, even though my significantly larger iPad Pro device would render the same pages with an easier-to-tap mobile layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one occasion, the Calendar app completely froze and became unresponsive until I plugged in the Type Cover and disabled tablet mode. The fact that such a nonsensical solution fixed my problem is training me to try foolish things to workaround issues I encounter, which is a hallmark reason I left Windows years ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software keyboard is irredeemably bad. For some reason, mine will arbitrarily capitalize characters as I’m typing. This is a sentence that I typed with the software keyboard, careful to note that my finger hit the correct physical location of each key icon: “Its NicE that the pdnConnectS magnEtiCaLly tonthE dise of tJe caSe” (translation: “It’s nice that the pen connects magnetically to the side of the case”.) This isn’t a one-off example. Every sentence I typed with the software keyboard looks like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animations and transitions are few and far between. Collectively, the operating system fails to develop a clear sense of place when in everything-is-full-screen tablet mode, which is obviously more necessary than in desktop mode where the user’s ability to organize windows establishes a sense of place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Surface is easily the worst tablet I’ve ever used, but up until now I’ve only really used iPads. I don’t think I’d ever go out of my way to use it without the keyboard unless I was reading a long document and it was literally the only device I had on hand. Rather than delighting me by feeling tangible and physical, as the iPad has always excelled at, the Surface-as-tablet feels finicky and fussy. I felt like I was constantly fighting with it: struggling to read small text, failing to hit small tap targets, accidentally tapping icons that would change the entire screen’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-surface-pen&#34;&gt;The Surface Pen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of the Apple Pencil. It’s accurate, has no perceptible input lag, recognizes strokes at extreme angles, and is a nice way to navigate the iPad from a distance. As a result, I was eager to compare the Surface Pen, given how prominently it features in Microsoft’s marketing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you double-click the Pen’s “eraser”, it’ll save a screenshot to OneDrive. This is pretty neat, especially because I take a lot of screenshots. Unfortunately, when I opened OneDrive two days later, all my screenshots were gone. (That’s why this post is one huge wall of text; I didn’t feel like going in and recreating dozens of screenshots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tip of the Pen does not depress, but I was convinced that it did, because in order to trigger a tap event with the pen it needs to be nearly perpendicular to the screen. Scrolling and selecting text works reliably up to a 45-degree angle (compared to near 90-degree with the Apple Pencil), but for some reason a direct tap won’t register a click event unless I press it very intentionally and straight on. This has made the Pen much less enjoyable for me to use to navigate the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pen seems to be designed with two-handed use in mind. I can scroll text with my finger but doing the same with the pen triggers text selection instead. This would probably work really well if I spent a lot of time marking up documents, but for basic navigation I’d much rather the Pen would just scroll so that I could give my fingers a rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Surface ships with a handwriting keyboard. The first time I used it, it failed to detect any letters I wrote and I thought it was probably just &lt;a href=&#34;http://shinyverse.org/larryy/ANHR.html&#34;&gt;Newton-tier junk&lt;/a&gt;. That was, of course, until my next system restart seemed to fix it. (Aside: I’m disappointed by how often a restart resolves my problems.) Once fixed, and though my handwriting is pretty awful, the handwriting detection of the Pen keyboard was pretty solid overall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One issue with the handwriting keyboard is that the autocomplete suggestions start at the far left of the screen and work their way to the right, in decreasing order of confidence. That means that the user is incentivized to write with the pen along the awkward left edge of the device rather than in comfortable center. I found myself dropping the Surface when handwriting in earnest as my hand would slip as I put all my weight on the far left side of the tablet in order tap the best autocomplete matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full-width design of the Pen keyboard suggests to the user they can write in complete left-to-right sentences, but if a single word is interpreted by autocomplete incorrectly, a single tap of backspace will &lt;em&gt;delete the entire sentence&lt;/em&gt;. There is almost no way this is the intended way for the Pen keyboard to be used, but I bet the full-width keyboard design looked great in storyboards and prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One gesture the Pen offers is to “press and hold the eraser to activate Cortana” (Microsoft’s voice-enabled personal assistant). This is a really cool feature, but for the fact that holding the eraser button is the same gesture one makes to pair the Pen to a Surface device. The first time I tried this gesture, Cortana failed to appear for whatever reason. Ignorantly, I continued to hold down the eraser, but eventually the Pen disconnected from the Surface. It took me over ten minutes to figure out that the Pen was disconnected (no clicks worked, but basic tapping still did). Ultimately, I had to open the Bluetooth control panel and again throw the Pen into pairing mode to reconnect it. It was a miserable experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Pen is fine, I guess. If I want to draw a thing and want to go out of my way to not use my iPad Pro, I’d use it. But I won’t carry it around with the Surface with the intention of navigating about the system like I do with the Apple Pencil. So far, 90% of my use for the Pen has been to double-tap the eraser to snag a screenshot into OneNote, and even that is only because I don’t know the shortcut to accomplish the same thing with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-user-experience&#34;&gt;General User Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other UI and UX observations I jotted down but aren’t easily categorized elsewhere, so I’ll unceremoniously foist them upon you here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hear Windows users express a lot of antipathy towards Microsoft’s handling of “HiDPI” (e.g. retina) displays, and I’m not sure if that’s where the blame lies for this, but in general I found a lot of text throughout the operating system and its stock applications to be almost illegibly small. I did find one control panel that allowed me to increase the font size system-wide, but it didn’t appear to affect very much. I have pretty good vision, but my eyes strain easily, and I feel them tire within 30 minutes of using the Surface, which is a problem I haven’t had on Apple devices for years (devices on which I also crank up the system-wide font size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel overwhelmed and claustrophobic when I’m in the desktop. I think a lot of this is just that I’m simply not used to it, but for me, Windows lacks whatever it is that makes a design feel “inviting” to be played with as opposed to “vaguely alienating” and confusing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Windows-D keyboard shortcut will hide every window and display the desktop. In macOS, I set up a hot corner to accomplish the same thing, and I tend to use it frequently. In Windows, though, when I tap Windows-D a second time it fails to restore focus exactly as it was previously. Instead, it seems to just barf up all of your windows at random depths. It’s not uncommon for me to hit Windows-D, look at the desktop, hit Windows-D again, and find that the app I’d been using isn’t even visible with the clutter of other windows that just got spewed on top. Did someone design this intentionally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shortcut I use in macOS Finder all the time is “quick look”, which is invoked by pressing the space bar and is able to provide a quick preview of countless types of files. Windows File Explorer, by contrast, only offers basic thumbnails of images and—it seems—not a whole lot more. Double-clicking an image that I want to preview prompts Windows to permanently add it to my Photos library, which is almost never what I want. I find myself desperately wanting a quick-look equivalent in Windows, or at the very least a built-in equivalent to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_%28macOS%29&#34;&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very minor thing, but it’s humorous to me that the primary means of launching apps, Windows Search, is invoked by the shortcut Windows-Q, which happens to be the same shortcut macOS offers for &lt;em&gt;quitting&lt;/em&gt; the current app. The tie goes to Apple here, if only because the letter “Q” features prominently in the word “quit” and is nowhere to be found in the word “search”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 10 finally offers a sensible file path for a user’s home directory (e.g. &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\justin&lt;/code&gt;) but doesn’t actually expose this home directory anywhere in File Explorer. I had to type it out and drag it to the sidebar to make it easily accessible (macOS Finder hides the user’s home directory behind a setting, which is also frustrating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does Windows still use drive letters like &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; instead of human-readable labels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CPU fan turns on without warning and when the system isn’t under obvious load. I understand that any sufficiently fast Intel x86 CPU requires active cooling, but it seems like this should at least afford me a UI that’s as responsive as the passively-cooled iPad Pro, and it doesn’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of apps send frequent notification banners without express permission and I can’t figure out how to disable them reliably&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In macOS, apps generally allow you to resize content with &lt;code&gt;cmd-+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, or if you’re in a productivity app with adjustable font sizes, &lt;code&gt;cmd-shift-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;. I’ve found myself hunting for an analogous keyboard shortcut that I can use throughout most Windows apps, and so far have only found MS Edge (as browsers typically ship with a content zoom). Frustrated, I’ve resigned myself to needing to frequently lean in to read the screen. Office is particularly egregious in this regard, sporting the same set of discrete zoom settings as it did in the late-90s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Update is slow and has failed as often as it’s succeeded so far. This morning I watched it run from 1% complete, to 27% complete, to telling me it had failed, to restarting, to 1% complete, to 27%, to restarting again, to finally booting to the desktop. What about the design of Windows causes updates to fail so frequently? More broadly, why do so many updates require a stop-the-world-now strategy of forcing the user to restart the machine? By contrast, macOS only releases four or five software updates that require a system-wide restart per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows’ default behavior with compressed files seems as half-cocked today as it did when WinZip was still a must-install application. Double-clicking a zip file will open the compressed folder in a pseudo-window from which executables cannot be launched. In macOS, opening a zip file decompresses it to a directory of the same name alongside the archive. The latter is more roundabout, but spares the user from ever having to conceive of being inside a “fake” directory inside which nothing works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Windows is still Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cortana&#34;&gt;Cortana&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t used Cortana much yet, but the praise I’ve heard .NET developers heap upon it seems overblown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicking the Cortana button does not engage the microphone, because it’s also a text input. In macOS, Siri and Spotlight handle voice and text input, respectively (which, at times, is separately frustrating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I click the Cortana button and then the microphone icon and then immediately start speaking, Cortana will always miss the first half-second of whatever it is I said, bungling the entire query and forcing me to repeat it. It’s 2016 and I’m still waiting for Windows to be ready to receive my input before I give it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I asked Cortana “how’s the weather today” and it returned links to four completely irrelevant YouTube videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cortana can’t seem to toggle device settings like Siri often can. Asking it to exit tablet mode, for example, resulted in a verbatim Bing search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voice-based personal assistants are still pretty awful, all-around, and Cortana is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;microsoft-edge&#34;&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Edge browser has been a highlight of this experience. It’s lean and mean, just like Safari on macOS. I definitely prefer it to Chrome, just as I do Safari on the Mac. Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge is minimalist, renders pages quickly, and features UI controls whose input latency is no worse than the rest of operating system. This compares very favorably to Internet Explorer, which Edge replaces, and represents 90% of what I look for in a browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitting Ctrl-T to open a new tab is a jarring experience, as the keyboard’s focus is placed on a search box in the center of the window as opposed to a populating a clear address bar at the top. This is actually a more honest UI, because it telegraphs to the user that every one of their keystrokes is being uploaded to Bing, but the incongruity with the position of the location bar of every other tab is aesthetically awkward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my favorite features of Safari is &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21467?locale=en_US&#34;&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which presents the current page in an advertisement-and-clutter-free view that has reliably decent typography. Edge has a similar “&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17204/windows-10-take-your-reading-with-you&#34;&gt;Reading view&lt;/a&gt;”, which is more than can be said of Google Chrome (which would never introduce such a feature, since Google makes money off the display ads that such a feature is designed to circumvent). However, the implementation of Edge’s reader lags far behind Safari in typography, responsiveness, and accuracy. In Safari, the reader button and shortcut become enabled as soon as the DOM is initially loaded, but I found that Edge’s Reading View icon would remain grayed out until every resource and advertisement on the page finished loading, which undercut the feature’s purpose significantly. Moreover, Edge’s reading mode would often pick up superfluous bits of other articles from invisible DOM elements. This happened often enough that I found myself confused while reading, forcing me to exit reading view to visually inspect the article (if you’re curious, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/22/14052150/magsafe-replacement-usb-c-power-data-video&#34;&gt;this Verge article&lt;/a&gt; for an example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I leave a tab open for more than a few minutes, Edge would get confused about the height of any scrollable and editable content (think: a notes editor at iCloud.com or a spreadsheet on Google docs) and refuse to allow me to scroll the full height of the content with the trackpad or touchscreen. Instead, I found myself forced to scroll with arrow keys or the Pen’s text selection unless I reloaded the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding your downloads is more tricky than it ought to be. In macOS, there’s a default “stack” along the dock that prominently displays your most-recent downloads. Edge’s download sidebar has a link to show the downloads directory, but for some reason, clicking it always opened the directory behind all my current windows, requiring that I go hunt for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge supports resumable downloads, but on a couple occasions when a download was interrupted and I clicked “resume”, I’d get a message saying “resume failed. Retry?” So then I’d click “retry” and I’d get a message saying the file “couldn’t be downloaded”. So then I’d go find the exact same link I initially clicked, click it, and it would start downloading. This experience made me recall fond memories of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abort,_Retry,_Fail%3F&#34;&gt;[A]bort [R]etry [F]ail&lt;/a&gt; prompt, which featured prominently in my DOS-based youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge struggles with editable content that butts up against the edges of the window. For instance, if I hit return at the bottom of a window while editing this Medium post, macOS Safari will add some additional padding to ensure the text insertion point is within view, whereas on Edge the text insertion point would often be clipped outside my view, and I’d have to hit enter and then scroll down to see what I was typing. Whether this is a browser compatibility failure or Edge’s fault, I don’t know (or much care), but it seems to happen whenever I’m in a web app that expects a lot of text input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Edge seems like a pretty competent browser. I was skeptical at first, because Edge was a fork (as opposed to a rewrite) of the same engines that powered Internet Explorer, but I was generally satisfied with its speed and accuracy of rendering and most of its quirks are forgiveable disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;windows-mail&#34;&gt;Windows Mail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stock app that I configured after exiting the Surface’s initial setup wizard was the built-in Mail app. I configured my two Google mail accounts and sent a few e-mails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After setting up my personal Gmail account, I clicked “Add Account” again to add my work account, but the button stopped working. Try as I might, I couldn’t get the button to work again until I restarted the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After restarting the app and adding my work account, I noticed that Windows Mail doesn’t feature a universal inbox, and every setting is made on a per-account basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first e-mail I sent with Mail featured a gaudy “Sent from Windows Mail” signature, so I hopped into the preferences to disable it. It was gross when iOS included this as a default and it’s gross when Apple’s competitors do, too. Worse, the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; e-mail I sent also had this signature on it, because I didn’t realize that the setting needed to be applied to each mail account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail doesn’t seem to download HTML messages or images in e-mail by default, instead requiring the user to opt-in with a click. Honestly, this is a refreshing default, given how every e-mail marketer &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_rate#Email_Open_Rate&#34;&gt;uses magic pixels&lt;/a&gt; to track who opens each e-mail and when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact Mail doesn’t have a universal inbox and that its swipe gestures don’t apply to the trackpad, it seems like a serviceably good native Mail application. I won’t cover Calendar in depth here, but it was at least sharp enough to carry over my Google accounts and seemed to work well enough at first blush. I suspect I’d have a longer list for each if I tried to live in them for a week, as—and I admit this with a deep and profound sadness—I rely heavily on e-mail and calendar apps every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-party-apps&#34;&gt;Third-party Apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a little about getting third-party software installed. It’s funny, because Windows was so dominant when I last used it personally in 2003 that I struggled to switch to the Mac for want of alternatives to my favorite Windows apps. Now, through a combination of unfamiliarity and Microsoft’s own failure to build a successful mobile platform, the tables are turned and I’m struggling to fill out the desktop software I’d like to stay productive in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the good ol’ days, every single Windows app shipped with a mysterious install wizard. Telling what those install wizards were doing to the underlying file system or registry was an often impossible task, however. Many apps still install this way, and the Windows &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control&#34;&gt;User Account Control&lt;/a&gt; remains as useless for informing me of what the installer is doing today as it was when it was unveiled in 2006&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the complication of installers, “portable” or “standalone” executables emerged as a popular alternative. These standalone apps are often served up in a compresed file and can be extracted and run from anywhere on the filesystem. This creates its own problems, though, because unlike macOS, where such files are expected to be dragged to the &lt;code&gt;/Applications&lt;/code&gt; directory and automatically registered with and indexed by the operating system, Windows seems blissfully unaware of any portable apps, even if they’re explicitly dragged into the &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files (x86)&lt;/code&gt; directories. When I manually installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmder.net&#34;&gt;Cmder&lt;/a&gt;, nothing I did could get Windows Search to find it, so there was constant friction whenever I wanted to launch it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of, why are there still two directories for storing applications on Windows, why are they still called “Program Files”, and why is there still no rhyme or reason to how apps are organized on disk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is, like the Mac App Store, a Windows Store app. Sadly, it seems like even more of a ghost town than the Mac App Store, and I didn’t find much use for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many tasks that developer-focused applications need to accomplish will require escalated privileges from the operating system, but few (if any) of these apps request privileged escalation on a narrow, task-by-task basis. (macOS makes this easy with API-triggerable password dialogs or Unix’s &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; command.) Instead, in Windows, I’ll often perform a command in terminal, only to see it fail, which then requires me to remember, “oh, right, I should have launched the terminal in Administrator mode,” forcing me to start from the beginning. This sort of foresight shouldn’t be the user’s responsibility, and leads to people giving apps escalated privileges more often than is necessary, which in turn exposes them to added security risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 1Password Windows app feels like a third-class citizen until you find out that there’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.agilebits.com/2016/06/02/1password-6-beta-for-windows-opens-the-door-to-1password-families-and-1password-teams/&#34;&gt;beta of 1Password 6&lt;/a&gt; which upgrades you to the second-class cabin. Sadly, they still don’t have a plugin for Edge, but I’m not going to feign surprise that an Apple-first software vendor doesn’t have fantastic Windows apps. That doesn’t change the fact that 1Password’s awkwardness in Windows increases the cost to switching to the platform, as I store over 2300 logins and encrypted notes in 1Password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s an official Twitter client for Windows 10 and it’s even worse than all the other official clients. It crashed constantly and when it wasn’t crashing, I had no idea what it was doing, so users of other official Twitter clients should feel right at home. I searched high and low for a third-party client half as good as &lt;a href=&#34;http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/&#34;&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/a&gt; and gave up. Bright side: maybe no Twitter means I’ll be more productive in Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sole silver-lining of my experience with third-party apps on Windows was when I started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org&#34;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;, which is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nuget.org&#34;&gt;Nuget&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&#34;https://caskroom.github.io&#34;&gt;Cask&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; on macOS. I stopped using Cask to install GUI apps on my Mac because it didn’t have a story for updating apps (and sometimes would complicate existing ones), but I was so starved for a reliable way of installing apps at all on Windows, that when Chocolatey proved able, I dropped everything to start using it. The first apps I installed each successfully registered with Windows Search: 7zip, VS Code, Cmder, and Steam. Kudos to whoever works on Chocolatey and Nuget—Microsoft should be funding it themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only started scratching the surface on third-party apps that I’ll need for getting my development workflow set up, but I’ll save that post for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-conclusions&#34;&gt;Initial conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into this experiment with a strong and clear bias. I am currently, happily entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem and my recollection of being a Windows user is generally negative. Nothing, so far, nothing has challenged that bias. It’s possible that—and this might be especially true for folks who’ve never strayed from the Microsoft ecosystem—things have been improving dramatically in Windows-land lately, and so the relativistic impression for longtime Windows users may well be that things are great, but I sadly can’t confirm that report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my (literally, due to strain) tired eyes, it feels like Microsoft is just barely treading water to stay current with the web, mobile, and touch revolutions that they successively missed the boat on. I don’t get the sense that Windows or the Surface represents an understanding of why its platforms faltered in the past nor does it seem to chart a bold direction towards a clear future. The best thing Windows 10 has going for it is that Microsoft has concluded it’s dominance is not vital to their financial success. If there is a creed among the Windows team, one can only assume it is, “be all things to all people.” A lofty goal, but one which also dooms it to mediocrity. Windows would only be my choice for a task barring a complete lack of alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to stick out the rest of this month-long experiment, however, because once I’ve gotten over the hump of initial configuration and culture-shock, I should be able to hone in on identifying focused development feedback loops. But I’m not quite there yet. I need a few days for Windows to sink in first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part of this experiment is that I’ve noticed that I’ve been short-tempered with those around me—an angry hangover that lasts hours after I’ve stopped using Windows. It is as if the friction I encounter in the Windows UI accretes in me literal adrenaline, which in turn triggers me to lash out at my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps it’s just the holiday spirit. Hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a lot more to say about my experiments in &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/giving-windows-a-chance-39f4d7f1b93c#.tu03xvkh0&#34;&gt;trying out Windows&lt;/a&gt; over the coming days, but as a special Christmas bonus edition, I thought I’d share the steps that were apparently required for me to register my Surface Pro 4 with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got in bed last night, I activated &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17210/windows-10-use-your-pc-like-a-tablet&#34;&gt;tablet mode&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and while perusing the don’t-call-it-Metro tile page, I saw an app called “Surface”. &lt;em&gt;I have one of those,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;I should tap that!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first blush, the purpose of the app is to introduce you to the Surface’s features, process device registration, solicit customer feedback, and so forth. The first thing the app asks of its users is to register the Surface device for benefits that include both requesting (and cancelling!) hardware service. Since part of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/giving-windows-a-chance-39f4d7f1b93c#.z6znqibds&#34;&gt;aforementioned experiment&lt;/a&gt; is to begrudgingly click “yes” to every asanine pop-up and prompt the operating system throws at me, I decided to go ahead and register the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-register-the-surface-pro-4&#34;&gt;How to register the Surface Pro 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the registration prompt looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WVPokFZ_beZBzBAIgc0Uog.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inital reaction to this screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do I need to tell my Surface Pro 4 what product I’m using?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I only knew the correct answer to this question—which lists dozens of products—because I’m paying extra-close attention as I learn how to Windows. (Then again, I doubt many non-geeks would ever wind up finding this Surface app to begin with—a separate issue.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why doesn’t the device know its own serial number?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Apple products automatically register themselves as soon as a user sets up iCloud, and most users will never see their serial number. &lt;em&gt;At the very least&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered, &lt;em&gt;this app must have access to the data needed to autopopulate this field, wouldn’t it&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I switched focus to the “Serial Number” input box, a “Where do I find this?” link appeared. Clicking it displayed this pop-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TlccentskoQaeDfCzvFZbA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;That non-retina Ⓧ button is just one of hundreds of UI elements that shatter any illusion I’m dealing with “real” controls&#34; /&gt;
That non-retina Ⓧ button is just one of hundreds of UI elements that shatter any illusion I’m dealing with “real” controls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dark in the room and I was in my bed, so I couldn’t read the serial from the back of the device. Opting to follow the strangely-roundabout instructions at the bottom of the pop-up, I gathered that my task would involve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening the Surface app (✔︎&lt;em&gt;, but you’re the Surface app, silly!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copying the serial number (❓&lt;em&gt;, ok, but I don’t see it—and you just implied that you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;know my serial number!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering it in the “Serial Number” text box (&lt;em&gt;Sure thing&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;finding-the-serial-number&#34;&gt;Finding the serial number&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I spent over 5 minutes hunting around, trying to find the serial number from within the Surface app. I drilled into literally every single one of these sub-menus, failing to find it in any of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_2BSLGdZVZc65rPfxjWeTg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Nope, no serial numbers here&#34; /&gt;
Nope, no serial numbers here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my eyes were drawn to the app’s sidebar of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_meat_navigation&#34;&gt;mystery meat navigation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3oyX70V35uAfcdF7KjmA8Q.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A home, a pen, falling dominos, and a smiley face&#34; /&gt;
A home, a pen, falling dominos, and a smiley face&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 seems to be full of groupings of generic icons unadorned with any text labels. For what it’s worth, as a Mac user, I’ve always been partial to Apple’s old Human Interface Guidelines team’s quote, “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asktog.com/columns/038MacUITrends.html&#34;&gt;a word is worth a thousand pictures&lt;/a&gt;”. I was near the point of giving up when I thought, &lt;em&gt;I don’t know, maybe the smiley face? People associate smiley faces with serial numbers and MAC IDs, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackpot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0nOn2Ghdk_3oHV3gwYaNQw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Does my kneejerk repulsion to this screen qualify as responsive design?&#34; /&gt;
Does my kneejerk repulsion to this screen qualify as responsive design?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, now I had to figure out how to scroll the frame-within-a-frame-within-a-pane of the “Your Surface Device” box to actually see the serial number. I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pen/productID.325724000&#34;&gt;Surface Pen&lt;/a&gt; to carefully scroll the box that contained my serial number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DDHCKWkiaid90DRjoDYq5g.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;These numbers have been deleted because I don’t understand what you could do to me if you knew them.&#34; /&gt;
These numbers have been deleted because I don’t understand what you could do to me if you knew them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok, let’s just select the serial text—wait a minute!&lt;/em&gt; It dawned on me that none of the text in this UI control was actually able to be selected by the user. This was another point of friction that caused me to pause and think (since I hadn’t yet encountered another text field like this). &lt;em&gt;Perhaps this was some kind of strange security mechanism to avoid scraping the text?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If so, wouldn’t it be quickly defeated by the gigantic “Copy” button?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without other apparent recourse, I clicked “Copy”, figuring that’d at least suck up my serial number in its wake. I switched back to the registration pane (which required me to again drill-down two menus after tapping on the falling dominos in the side bar). Next, I tapped the “Serial Number” text box and pasted whatever had just been loaded into the clipboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z5HeYaClq92rzBc4_L-83w.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Seems legit&#34; /&gt;
Seems legit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ugh.&lt;/em&gt; Clearly, I got more than I bargained for here. So, using the software keyboard, I painstakingly backspaced, selected, and edited the text in the text input so that it only contained the serial number. I made sure to delete any leading or trailing whitespace, too (I wasn’t about to chance having to do this again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I clicked Register, I glanced at my phone to take note of the steps I’d been taking, and when I looked back at the Surface, I was greeted with nothing but the registration page, once again blank:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VqK_7PG0tvtH2ERuthZKqw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;So this is what a time loop feels like.&#34; /&gt;
So this is what a time loop feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh no! What just happened!&lt;/em&gt; I scrolled up for an error to see if the registration failed. Not finding one, I verified in MS Edge that I was still online. I was. Defeated, I decided to just try everything over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point, I had forgotten where I’d just found the serial number earlier. Somehow I hadn’t yet come to associate smiley faces with serial numbers, so it took me another few minutes of diving through all the help menus before remembering to tap ☺︎.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I repeated the painful text editing steps above and watched &lt;em&gt;very intently&lt;/em&gt; as I tapped the “Register” button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AKrkJKLIivqbmhOD7HuSNQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Don’t blink or you’ll miss it&#34; /&gt;
Don’t blink or you’ll miss it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huzzah! I’d registered my Surface!&lt;/em&gt; I welled with pride in having figured out how to accomplish the perfunctory task, completely forgetting that the whole point of vertically integrating hardware and software was so Microsoft could manage this kind of minutae on behalf of its users. I was too busy being proud to take stock of all the precious moments of my Christmas Eve holiday that I had so far wasted on this endeavor. (Really! It felt good to defeat the form!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not 500 milliseconds later, the success message disappeared, only to be replaced by the once-again empty registration form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VqK_7PG0tvtH2ERuthZKqw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;This feature is actually Microsoft’s [Groundhog Day](http://imgur.com/47l7tAF) easter egg.&#34; /&gt;
This feature is actually Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgur.com/47l7tAF&#34;&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/a&gt; easter egg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind immediately flooded with self-doubt: &lt;em&gt;wait, so did I actually register it or not? Why’s it asking me to register again? How can I be sure it just worked? If I call Microsoft at midnight on Christmas Eve will they answer and verify this for me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, I still don’t know if the device is registered. I have to assume it’s fine. Of course, I’m sure I could have obtained warranty service even if I’d never bothered to register. Which prompts me to wonder why I put myself through this exercise to begin with, but for the fact that I’m trying to take the operating system at its word instead of dismissing every pop-up it spews at me as being a frivolous waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m registered enough&lt;/em&gt;, I concluded, and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought a Surface Pro 4 tonight. Over the next week I’m going to share my notes on getting used to it. And over the next month I’m going to attempt to do all of my open source work from it. but tonight, I want to first comment on the state of the Mac and PC so that I can get my own initial perspective and biases on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent posts in this series include: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/registering-a-microsoft-surface-pro-4-17c05d6d2e7a#.rpnvcipn6&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/warm-takes-on-microsofts-surface-pro-4-580f77634d2c#.ceo1tibrz&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-m-a-mac&#34;&gt;I’m a Mac&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other “open source” developers, I used DOS and Windows throughout the 90s, then toyed with (but failed to successfully adopt) desktop Linux, before ultimately switching to Mac OS X. I bought my first Mac, an iBook G4, in the summer of 2004 — and I’ve never looked back. Well, until tonight, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about the “look and feel” of OS X has always been able to deceive my brain into believing I was interacting with &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; windows and knobs and sliders as opposed to consciously clicking on crude geometric shapes. Whenever I found myself using Windows (which I had to do daily at work for the next five or six years) it was a stark reminder of how even one point of friction could dispel any illusion that the computer’s graphical interface represented real objects. This sort of friction could be found everywhere in Windows: its choppy frame rate, lack of transition animations, inconsistent shading, jarringly-instantaneous scrolling, unnatural mouse cursor acceleration, and seconds-long click delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I encountered that friction, I was sucked immediately out of productive flow and subsequently sidetracked into a rabbit hole of obsessive customization and configuration to attempt to ameliorate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-windows-comeback&#34;&gt;The Windows comeback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But that was the old Windows! It got better!” is a refrain I’ve been hearing more and more as Satya Nadela’s masterful turnaround of the mess Ballmer made starts to yield fruit. Friends of mine now work for Microsoft on open source, building support for languages that were verboten among the Microsoft faithful just a few years ago. Microsoft’s focus on services over platform dominance has given them the flexibility — perhaps even the imperative — to embrace outside software communities. This has earned them tremendous goodwill among many software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it enough goodwill to convince developers to start working in Windows? That depends, in part, on two things: the degree of a developer’s mastery of Unix and the extent to which Microsoft succeeds in integrating a Linux subsystem into the broader Windows experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Mac’s convincing and coherent graphical interface drew developer flies to honey, then its certified Unix underpinnings served as the Venus flytrap. 10 years ago I could consider moving back to Windows, but only because I didn’t yet understand or appreciate how powerful the Unix toolchain is for facilitating software development. “Windows is an operating system for using applications, Unix is an operating system for &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; them,” some would say. Mac OS X had emerged as a superb contender on both fronts, simultaneously cutting off any inroads that desktop Linux was making while so delighting users as to capture virtually all of the industry’s profit in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem counterintuitive that Microsoft’s throwing in of the towel on its decades-old strategy of platform dominance would suddenly increase interest in adoption of said platform, but the aforementioned goodwill is palpable. A lot of developers, apparently frustrated with Apple’s tight control of its ecosystem, have been eyeing the progress of Bash for Windows as a logical jumping-on point to give Windows a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;and-then-apple-unveiled-the-late-2016-macbook-pro&#34;&gt;…and then Apple unveiled the Late-2016 MacBook Pro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple keynote that unveiled the new MacBook Pro was a clarifying event for me. It reminded me that many of today’s developers got on board with Apple for the same reason I used Windows throughout the 90s: its dominance made it the default choice. Whatever a 2016 developer’s reason for using a Mac might be, it’s no longer assured that they do so because they first bought into Apple’s design philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlash following the unveiling was bewildering to the Apple faithful bloggerati. &lt;em&gt;These new MacBooks are better in every way than their predecessors&lt;/em&gt;, they thought, &lt;em&gt;why would people threaten to jump ship?&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps it was because these ship-jumpers didn’t previously realize where the ship was heading. Most developers using Macs today have only ever owned one of them, and the 2016 model provided them a second data point from which to draw a line, thereby revealing the difference between Apple’s and their own priorities as they extrapolated forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a new generation of Mac users were outraged that Apple was factoring weight and size into the trade offs driving the design of their portable computers. A thousand tweetstorms were born on the assumption that the word “Pro” implied maximum theoretical computing power at all costs. Oh, and speaking of costs, it was too expensive for these “pros” to afford, as well. If this was the laptop of the future, its 16GB maximum RAM indicated it had failed… yet it was simultaneously insufficiently reverent of the past, sporting only USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This garbled, confused counter-messaging came courtesy of a diverse group of users who got on board with the Mac mostly because it had been the default, mainstream choice. As a result, that they represented a messy, discordant cacophony of viewpoints should come as no surprise. In fact, it should remind us of the dilemma Microsoft faced in the early 2000s as their Windows XP hegemony peaked. There was nowhere left to go but down, and the price Microsoft had paid in the form of extreme configurability and corporate control had sapped the platform of any freedom of strategic (much less tasteful) movement. Apple may not have achieved the same market monopoly Microsoft did, but they’ve effectively backed themselves into the same corner by thoroughly dominating the market of “people willing to pay a premium for a computer they will enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;intentional-read-old-mac-users&#34;&gt;Intentional (read: old) Mac users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances by which I switched to the Mac couldn’t have been more different. Apple was a scrappy underdog by nearly every measure. I decided to dive headfirst into their ecosystem after realizing how much less friction I would encounter if I simply relied exclusively on Apple&#39;s devices, services, and even their much-derided “stock” apps. (That’s right, I use Reminders, Mail, and Calendar, and it saves me a ton of time to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where others bristle at Apple’s assertion of control, I find the constraints it places on me to be liberating. I used to buy devices only for the thrill of exploring all of the ways I could configure them. But I slowly became aware of the paradox of choice I&#39;d surrounded myself with, realizing I was paying an ongoing customization tax, and that it was enough to severely diminish my productivity. Working within a thoughtfully constrained system — even if it required I acquiesce to someone else’s opinions — has helped me to focus my mental energy on the problem I’m actually trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a humbling, multi-year transformation I went through, and I now see it was foolish to assume most other Mac users had gone through it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the effects this mindset-shift can have, consider hardware design. Many developers mock Apple’s love of thinness when it comes at the expense of maxing out a device’s technical specifications, but I’ve always found Apple’s hardware design to be calmingly consistent. I imagine Apple hardware design starts with a Platonic form residing primarily in the mind of Jony Ive. Suppose that the form of the ideal MacBook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a 1mm thin piece of continuous aluminum that happens to crease at the halfway point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a battery that lasts for days on end and charges wirelessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a trackpad and keyboard that — despite being impossibly thin — give one’s finger tips the &lt;em&gt;sensation&lt;/em&gt; of luxurious, clicky travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a processor fast enough and memory ample enough for the spinning beachball animation to be safely deleted from the operating system (iOS never needed one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a display that reproduces images as clearly as looking through a window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weighs just enough to avoid floating off your desk and escaping earth’s gravity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect Apple starts  there: with a perfect, unattainable design in mind. Everything that comes next is a painful trade off or unavoidable affordance deemed necessary to ship any product at all. Every Mac has been a reflection of the technical constraints of the day, but never so crudely as to be wholly defined by them. (Apple’s famous marketing then does its best to vault its products back into that Platonic heaven, starting with the the product photos backed by a pristine white background.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the average person, living on earth, reasonably evaluates the final physical products for what they are: compromised. They expect every component to feature best-in-class tech specs. They expect a price that matches the lowest-cost vendor. They expect everything familiar to them to be preserved in perpetuity. They expect to be wowed by surprising, innovative features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Apple and its presently-disgruntled users think that they’re imagining the perfect computer, but they clearly go about it very differently. Where Apple starts at the ideal form and compromises down, its users look at the compromised form and appeal each of those compromises narrowly, often losing sight of the impact one trade off would have elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;does-microsoft-finally-have-taste&#34;&gt;Does Microsoft finally have taste?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s a little bit about my experience living in Apple hardware for 12 years. My impression of Microsoft’s nascent consumer-facing industrial design is that it’s earnest. They’re hungry to find differentiating features to brag about, but also less concerned about the bulk and seams those features will require. But that’s about the extent of my thoughts so far. Before tonight I didn’t really know a Surface from a Surface Book. I wasn’t totally sure that Windows RT wasn’t still a thing (I was worried I might accidentally walk out the door with an ARM processor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned, a lot of my developer friends have recently started singing Windows’ praises, but — in light of the discussion above about the Mac’s primacy among developers — I can’t be too sure that they were ever the sort of True Believer in the Mac that I apparently am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is, lately I’ve noticed something I’m not proud of: whenever I hear about a developer willfully switching to Windows, I struggle to relate to them and make a number of harsh, judgmental assumptions. But those assumptions are unfair, in part because they’re not based on at-all recent experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, out of a profound sense of shame for the lack of empathy I’ve shown for developers who live in Windows-land, I bought my first-ever Microsoft-branded PC: a Surface Pro 4. I’m going to try to use it as much as possible for my open source development for the next month, using as many of Microsoft’s stock apps as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that I’ll walk away from this experience still thinking Windows is a usability nightmare, but I’m open to being convinced that Microsoft’s decade in the wilderness has given them the agility to turn Windows around. I’m going to do my best to document my observations as I go… observations I’m hopeful will not be overly negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned for a lot of angry tweets as I struggle to get used to Windows! 👌&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My wife &amp;amp; I have been returning to my parents house for Thanksgiving every year since we graduated college. Customarily, people stop schlepping home to exploit the free labor of their parents’ holiday cheer around the time they have kids—but for a growing number of millennials who &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming&#34;&gt;aren’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity&#34;&gt;interested&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump&#34;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity&#34;&gt;bringing&lt;/a&gt; children into the world, this presents a dilemma: do I expect my mom to cook me turkeys until she is physically unable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short answer: mostly, sure. [&lt;em&gt;Love you, mom!&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer answer: this year in particular, having logged over 25 weeks traveling, I was eager to stay home for the holidays for once. I still wanted a traditionally large and wasteful Thanksgiving feast, but I just didn’t have it in me to drive three hours for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raised another dilemma: if I’m too lazy to drive for free food, who’s going to make it for me at my house? Answer: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com&#34;&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;, apparently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, it’s common knowledge that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-dont-know-how-to-cook-2016-08-10&#34;&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/07/02/millennials-struggle-to-pass-life-skills-101&#34;&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.essence.com/2016/03/28/death-home-cooked-meals-among-millennials&#34;&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt;. We &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blueapron.com&#34;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hellofresh.com/tasty/&#34;&gt;venture-backed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://plated.com&#34;&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/article/hellofresh-ipo-idUSL8N12S12420151028&#34;&gt;subsidize delivered meals&lt;/a&gt; for us. Why pay more money for food I have to figure out how to make on my own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, too, I wanted to get something for nothing (in keeping with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rense.com/general45/thanks.htm&#34;&gt;true spirit of the holiday&lt;/a&gt;), so I was pretty jazzed when I learned that I could stroll up to a Whole Foods customer service representative and place an order for an “oven-ready” dressed turkey and a bevvy of pre-cooked accompaniments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ordering-the-bird&#34;&gt;Ordering the bird&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods starts taking orders on November 1st, I was told. I think. Nothing seems to be documented anywhere on the web, which may explain why this program seems to be so sparsely known. So, reluctantly, I drove into the store to place an offline order in person, just like in the forgotten days of the American frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A temporary holiday desk had been set up, and I grabbed the attendant’s attention. I didn’t hesitate to interrupt her lunch so that I could endlessly fuss about and ruminate out loud about &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; meal to her, albeit three weeks hence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After investing 20 minutes in a painful reconciliation process between Whole Foods’ printed “menu”—which lacked any prices—and the actual software catalog on the representative’s laptop, I received this confirmation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4XRHf8gVWml8aEpyvIGxww.png&#34; alt=&#34;The “Turkey Dinner” SKU naturally includes a 13-pound bird, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy.&#34; /&gt;
The “Turkey Dinner” SKU naturally includes a 13-pound bird, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reaction: &lt;em&gt;“Wait, all of that only cost&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$129.45?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;And it feeds “6–8” people, meaning it’ll be just the right amount for my wife &amp;amp; I? And I don’t have to put any money down? And it counts as groceries, so it’s tax-free?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer service representative confirmed that this deal did sound too-good-to-be-true. However, she was a bit uncomfortable ruling definitively on whether the meal would be exempt from sales-tax, as it was categorized as a grocery item, but marketed as “prepared”. Her deft ability to sidestep such a simple question tells me that she’s going make a great accountant someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;game-day&#34;&gt;Game day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed up at the store at 10:15 on Thanksgiving morning. The place was packed, the employees harried. I don’t think I saw a single woman customer. Perhaps this was the step in the all-day feasting process most likely to be delegated to men in the family. Or maybe men are more likely to favor the idea of consuming-but-not-preparing a Thanksgiving dinner. In either case, I got in line and waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, the ordeal necessary to pick up one box and three bags of food was pure chaos. Employees were arguing with each other—about what was included with what meal, about what kind of bird was in which box, over whether each item was “organic” or (I presume) inorganic. At one point, someone took my turkey away, replacing it, only to realize she’d been mistaken and confirmed that the original turkey was indeed mine. Although I could detect my blood pressure rising sympathetically, it made me glad that the worker had been mistaken, because I’d already named the turkey Dylan, and we had a big day planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just stood there and waited for the dust to settle before taking a very careful inventory. I could confirm that I had all the right foods, but the proportions seemed odd. Do I need two casserole dishes of stuffing but only one small container of mashed potatoes? Was that right? Who’s to say? The entire experience was anxiety-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;unpacking-things&#34;&gt;Unpacking things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I unpacked everything, it dawned on me that I’d just amassed 25 pounds of what basically amounted to cold takeout food at 10am on a Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RKd2FQ_Rqqh6zmwP7T5Biw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;See the bow around the turkey? Little touches.&#34; /&gt;
See the bow around the turkey? Little touches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reading the provided cooking &amp;amp; reheating instructions, I realized the trick to all of this would be to focus first on getting the turkey cooked, then in prepping the remaining items to be reheated simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by hastily throwing the bird in the oven on a cookie sheet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*snx_EquNhHkM6K-zgmyqxQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Not pictured: my excitement for getting to use my meat thermometer for the first and only time ever.&#34; /&gt;
Not pictured: my excitement for getting to use my meat thermometer for the first and only time ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I prepped the rest of the food so it would be ready to be reheated on the stovetop &amp;amp; the oven the instant that the turkey hit 165°:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LmwWid_oAnBbZ6Cc4CHqYg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Why’d I buy oyster bisque? Is that a thing people in New England eat at Thanksgiving or something?&#34; /&gt;
Why’d I buy oyster bisque? Is that a thing people in New England eat at Thanksgiving or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all I had to do was wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;waiting&#34;&gt;Waiting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, waiting is &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder millennials don’t cook. Am I just supposed to sit in front of the oven on my phone or something? Man, I really picked an awful month to &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/nero-may-have-fiddled-while-rome-burned-but-at-least-he-didnt-gawk-ec3988d20269#.m3cwk7mwy&#34;&gt;quit listening to podcasts and reading news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;eating&#34;&gt;Eating&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real talk: I still have no idea if any of this food is any good. I’m still waiting. Turkeys take forever. &lt;strong&gt;[Update: we ate the food! It was good!]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to pass the time, I decided to sit here and write this on my laptop while staring at the oven, wishing for Dylan to just finish up already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lo! The turkey is almost ready, so I guess I’ll stop writing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;should-you-do-this&#34;&gt;Should you do this?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were ever going to skip a family Thanksgiving political discussion, 2016 was the year to do it. I say enjoy an apolitical Thanksgiving with your extended family next year, but recommend you place a provisional Whole Foods order for November 2018, depending on how the Senate map looks. (Besides, it’s no-money-down—why not!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-giblets&#34;&gt;What are giblets?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one last thing, anyone know what I’m suppoesd to do with Dylan’s giblets?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time we had a talk about the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first time I heard a modem chime, I’ve been on a mission to discover, curate, and editorialize as much news as possible. Over the years, I’ve written for a variety of outlets — called “web sites” at first, then “blogs” for a while, and now subsumed by the lifeless social media platforms to which we all contribute. From the mid-nineties until I graduated college, I slowly optimized this information funnel — broadening the aperture of content I could absorb each day, while tightening my own editorial voice. Being informed calmed my anxieties about the unknown world, whereas honing a distinct persona gave me a sense of control as I navigated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But optimizations that lack a limiting factor run the risk of becoming too successful. My voracious appetite for novel content was so far outside the norm that a developer working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader&#34;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; once contacted me to ask what I was accomplishing by using the service — apparently it was unusual that I’d been reading an average of 900 articles a day at an uninterrupted pace for over 7 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it merely &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; normal because I’d gradually habituated myself to rapid consumption of news media. Reading hundreds of thousands of articles a year never occurred to me as strange, because the impulse to absorb information and share it with others seems so fundamental to the human experience. But I also know my case is extreme; early on, a series of events I still don’t understand led me to writing dozens of stories per day to audiences that numbered in the hundreds of thousands before I’d even entered high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An aside:&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes people ask me for advice on how to improve their writing. The best advice I have is to write news for an audience of hundreds of thousands of people and to then compulsively edit and re-edit every post until it’s free of any errors or imperfections, for fear of being found out to be a 13-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the people in my life have learned to accept my nervous addiction to distraction. My punctuated check-ins with Twitter. The glances I steal at my lock screen. But more subversive were the ways I found to sneak content consumption &amp;amp; editorialization into every moment of my day. Any moment of silence I encountered couldn’t be &lt;em&gt;enjoyed&lt;/em&gt;, because its very existence suggested I had failed to find the most efficient path to reaching my goal of reading everything that was happening in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, I can see now that my hobby-bordering-on-shadow-life has hardened me in ways I didn’t anticipate. When news of tragedy breaks, I don’t react. In fact, I completley fail to comprehend how news can elicit an emotional reaction in people. At times, I’ve even condescended others for feeling anything over awful events as they unfold thousands of miles away — don’t they read about all the other horrific things happening today? And where are their tears and outrage for the countless other stories that will never be emblazoned on a CNN chyron? It’s shameful to admit, but if breaking news of horrific events makes me feel anything, it’s annoyance at the fact that it will crowd out the coverage of topics I believe to be more consequential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a humane impulse. And I was just starting to see it in myself when, this week, the levy broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have related to news as a category of free, non-fiction entertainment. And how else would I relate to it? To the extent the news media is ever actually consequential, those consequences weren’t likely to be felt by me. But this week, even as I sit perched in a position of tremendous privilege, the same news I rely on to escape my reality seems likely to impact it. And the carefully-curated news sources I’ve arranged around myself like a pillow fort will afford me no more protection than a couch cushion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see now that the pull-to-refresh Skinner box I’ve housed myself in for decades has been monumentally counter-productive. The act of swiping to receive new information has, perversely, &lt;em&gt;sated&lt;/em&gt; any inclination to take further action in response. Hunting around the Internet for morsels of novel information requires a degree of exertion, and the fatigue that came from reading a hundred editorials before bed left me to falsely equate my own passive consumption with having actively contributed anything. But now I am keenly aware that I haven’t contributed much at all, pithy tweets included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take me a lot of time to understand the implications of this realization. For now, I can only see the first step I need to take: unilateral de-escalation. I’ve started by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Deleting all my RSS readers and news apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Unsubscribing from all my podcasts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Removing my access to cable &amp;amp; network news channels and other shows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Using my &lt;a href=&#34;https://1blocker.com&#34;&gt;ad blocker&lt;/a&gt; to block the news sites I habitually visit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Unfollowing some people on Twitter, and muting a lot of terms associated with the news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know I’ll fail if I quit cold turkey. I’m not prepared to suddenly embrace the hell that is quiet moments of a peaceful existence. Instead, I’m going to try to wean myself off my information addiction gradually. I’m thinking of it as a slow food movement for content. So far, I’ve done the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started listening to my first audiobook (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/American-Gods-The-Tenth-Anniversary-Edition-A-Full-Cast-Production-Audiobook/B0055274U2&#34;&gt;full-cast version of American Gods&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed oddly appropriate this week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent time organizing and browsing through Apple Music for new albums to queue up and listen to in a focused, thoughtful setting (I haven’t listened to music in a context apart from multitasking since college)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought a few video games with an intention of, for once, actually playing them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sat down for an uninterrupted two hours to write this post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see where this takes me, but I’m genuinely excited to reconnect with aspects of the human experience that are deeper and more permanent than the shallow and transient chatter I usually immerse myself in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in joining me and have any questions, don’t hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and ask!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phone-free Field Trips</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which we’re constantly connected via our phones is well-documented, thoroughly-researched, and intuitively understood by over a billion people. But we tend not to do much about it, because the benefits of being connected seem far more concrete than the relatively intangible benefits of being disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I was forced to reckon with this in a stark enough way to convince me to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lost-in-translation&#34;&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year 3 BiE (Before iPhone Era), I lived a nearly-entirely Internet-disconnected life for 7 months of adventures in Japan. I carried a dumb phone for emergencies, an electronic dictionary, and a camera. I didn’t know the language well. I would regularly show up in a new city and start exploring, which led to me getting lost, which led to me having interesting experiences, which led to a flood of all sorts of creative ideas from my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&#34;&gt;asynchronous brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been back to Japan 4 times since, in 2 AiE (After iPhone Era), 5 AiE, 8 AiE, and in the present year of 9 AiE. Each time, it’s been easier and easier to pop in a SIM card and have nearly unfettered access to the Western world I’d—at least physically—left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my subsequent travels in Japan lacked the exhilerating experience of exploring and losing myself in an unfamiliar world, they were full of stressful decisions about which &lt;a href=&#34;http://tabelog.com&#34;&gt;restaurants to eat at&lt;/a&gt; or which &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/&#34;&gt;hotel to book online&lt;/a&gt; for the next city I’d be visiting. This was even more fun for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/beckyjoy&#34;&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;, who rather than be burdened by the occassional and minor fear of the unknown was liberated by an incredibly stressed spouse, navigating maze-like train stations in a hurry while reconciling the paradox of choice that perhaps we were dining at merely the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298564-d3790646-Reviews-Sukiyaki_Kimura-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html&#34;&gt;second-best-sukiyaki joint&lt;/a&gt; in Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you can’t tell, I’m pretty pro at being hyper-aware of how awful the micro-optimizations that I’ve made for myself have made my overall life far less enjoyable. We all have our gifts, and hyper-awareness is mine.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-is-of-course-until&#34;&gt;That is, of course, until…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…a few days ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/searls/status/774100905041899520&#34;&gt;my phone broke&lt;/a&gt; and my world collapsed around me. I spent the first day in denial. The second day in anger (sorry, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubykaigi.org/2016&#34;&gt;everybody&lt;/a&gt;!). The third day (today) has been an exercise in bargaining (I’m typing this at the Apple Store in Osaka while I wait for the phone to be repaired at the risk I may receive a &lt;a href=&#34;http://naruhodo.jp.net/why-all-cellphones-camera-in-japan-shipped-with-shutter-sound/&#34;&gt;noisy Japanese replacement instead&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They told me to return in 90 minutes. That’d be 90 minutes without a phone. I’d merely have a MacBook and Apple Watch for an hour-and-a-half, in a city I actually know pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was appropriately panicked. &lt;em&gt;Should I stay in the safe confines of the admittedly crowded store?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Should I brave the elements and walk through the Shinsaibashi shopping arcade?&lt;/em&gt; I’ll go out, I thought, &lt;em&gt;but in a straight line, so I can reliably return without getting lost, let’s not get crazy here.&lt;/em&gt; I texted my wife to warn her I’d be disconnected for 90 minutes and waited for her acknowledgement before I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happened-next-will-shock-you&#34;&gt;What happened next will shock you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t die. I started noticing a lot of the little details of the world around me that I’d been blind to since that first trip I took to Japan, way back in 3 BiE. As I walked, I had the urge to reach into my empty pocket to snap a picture of the interesting things I saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I had no camera, so I can’t share a picture with you here in this post. Interestingly, I actually remember what I saw more vividly than I could had I outsourced the job to iCloud Photos. Fancy that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I stumbled upon a toy store for infants and toddlers before remembering &lt;em&gt;I am about to massively inconvenenience my very pregnant friend by staying at her house this week; perhaps I should buy her a gift&lt;/em&gt;. This thought would not have occurred to me had I been reading my RSS reader and getting angry about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/us/politics/donald-trump-sexual-assault-military-women.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;latest thing Trump said&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I bought a really nice, thoughtful gift! I’d been worried about finding a gift for days, and despite countless hours of sitting at my computer, I’d never found the time to simply go look for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-it-s-like-to-think-a-thought&#34;&gt;What it’s like to think a thought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I checked out but before the gift was wrapped, I had to sit for ten whole minutes without a phone. It was initially disconcerting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sat there with nothing to do, I had some interesting thoughts about the nature of stress in modern life. How very-immediate stressors are still quite effective because they approximate well-enough the conditions under which we evolved, but how more abstract stressors—for which everyone agrees our cortisol responses are ineffective—themselves vary dramatically depending on your life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reflected on how, back when I was wandering Osaka in 3 BiE, my abstract stressors were few but massive: I had hundreds of dollars to my name and tens of thousands in student loans; I had relatively poor job prospects; I didn’t know if I still believed in a God or whether that doubt would send me straight to hell. But other than that, 3 BiE &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;@searls&lt;/a&gt; had very little going on. Nobody needed me for much of anything. I got one or two e-mails a week. I had five or six things in my to-do list and they’d been dormant for months. I went to class, did my homework, and then did whatever I pleased. It’s true, I was nearly constantly wracked with abstract stressors that dominated the back of my mind, but there were only 3 or 4 of them and at any given time, relatively few actions I could take to abate the worry. On a scale of 1 to 10, I’d have said my stress level was an 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;@searls&lt;/a&gt; that stands before you in 9 AiE is in a completely different stage of life. All of the major, broad-stroke abstract stressors have long-since been resolved. I’m more successful personally and professionally than I ever dreamed I would be, and I’m incredibly fortunate to not have many long-term fears. However, my cadre of to-do apps runneth over with small-to-medium size things I know (and you know) that I’ll never ever get to. I won’t delete them, that’d be crass, but I will let them accumulate into the back of my head, until Apple announces a set of features for automatic history deletion alongside iOS 23 and macOS Mission. I feel constantly burdened with personalized requests for my time and attention by way of dozens of electronic vectors. On a scale of 1 to 10, I’d have said my stress level was an 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I’d ever considered that there is an inflection point in the nature of stress over the course of our lives, and that mine just happens to have coincided with this Cambrian explosion of infinitely connected devices. Detangling the two concepts in my mind will take a lot of work, but if it hadn’t been for this 90 minute walk, I’d never have thought of the analogy. Previously, I just knew my stress level was “about an 8” for the last decade of iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-was-neat-i-would-like-more-thoughts&#34;&gt;That was neat. I would like more thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to make a habit of this, and I’d recommend you try it. Every week, I’m going to go somewhere relatively unfamiliar without my phone for a little while. I’ll start with 90 minutes and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that “disconnectedness” is a muscle that our BiE ancestors didn’t know that they’d been developing, because my ability to think and act clearly and decisively without confirming with information or humans via the Internet has been wholly compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my first few field trips go well, maybe I’ll try going a little longer. Maybe someday I’ll spend a whole weekend somewhere without the ability to contact anyone online. At the incredible rate our connectedness is increasing, I’m not sure how much longer such a thing will even be possible without breaking a law or surgically extracting an electronic implant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this and thought “maybe I should take a phone-free field trip”, please give it a try! Find me here or &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and tell me how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I often tell people the only reason I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.testdouble.com&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=justin+searls&#34;&gt;speak&lt;/a&gt; is to guard against having the same conversation over and over again. So, here I go again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing I eat every day is dinner, meaning I don’t eat breakfast, lunch, or daytime snacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I run 3 miles every day, without exception. In spite of my travels taking me all over the world, I’m pretty sure I haven’t missed a run in two years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing these two things has improved my health considerably, saves a lot of time and money, and has improved my ability to focus on my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-you-do-that&#34;&gt;“How do you do that?!”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People’s first reaction to learning that I’m not eating anything at lunch is, as you might expect, shock and disbelief. But their curiosity in my lifestyle quickly transitions to internalization: “I could &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; do that!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it’s not hard at all to fast every day! While it came to me accidentally, it was surprisingly easy for &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/beckyjoy&#34;&gt;my wife&lt;/a&gt; to settle into, as well. It only takes about a week to acclimate, especially when you don’t allow for any exceptions. Pushing through the midday sensation of hunger—as unfamiliar to most Americans as genuine hunger is—can be challenging, but the urge to drop everything and eat usually passes after 30 minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as this lifestyle is difficult, I’ve found the absolutism of eating nothing at all before dinner requires far less discipline than trying to “eat right” throughout the day ever was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week or two, fasting becomes so routine that the concept of food each morning begins to feel literally repulsive until at least midday. After a couple years of fasting, I’m rarely appetized before 2pm. That makes turning down offers for lunch (even free lunch!) much less difficult. I’ll admit, though, that the cheapskate in me really regrets all the free lunches I’ve passed on since my mid-20s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-punish-yourself&#34;&gt;Why punish yourself?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why subject myself to this routine, when it’d be so much easier to conform to society’s norms of eating 3 squares a day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I struggled with obesity from childhood straight until I was an adult, and I’m still so bad at portion control that my default trajectory is consistent weight gain — even though I workout 30 minutes a day. As a consultant &amp;amp; speaker, my travel schedule has always been erratic, so even if it’s possible for me to fall into a healthy eating routine, I’ve never succeeded at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best yet, if you only eat one meal a day, it almost doesn’t matter what you eat, because you can only do so much damage in one sitting before your stomach is full. On that note, daily fasting has definitely “shrunk my stomach”; even though I might fascinate all afternoon about eating five racks of ribs to sate my hunger, my actual capacity for gorging myself is far less than it ever was when I was in the habit of eating three meals a day. When at restaurants, I frequently order far more than I can actually eat, confirming that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/have_eyes_bigger_than_one%27s_stomach&#34;&gt;my eyes are, indeed, larger than my stomach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, the biggest drawback to this entire regime might be how it’s weakened the value proposition all-inclusive resorts can hope to offer me. And if this article attracts smears, I’m confident it’ll be from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandals_Resorts&#34;&gt;Sandals&lt;/a&gt; corporation. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/Sandals-ends-long-term-ban-on-gay-couples/&#34;&gt;Jerks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;saving-time-money&#34;&gt;Saving Time &amp;amp; Money&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t grocery shop anymore, sparing me some of my least favorite time wasted and money spent. We keep a few snacks and beverages on hand, but we were surprised how much more of our refrigerator and pantry was stocked to facilitate the quick preparation of breakfasts and lunches over dinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, whatever economy of scale used to exist to support home cooking was turned on its head by eating only one meal a day—we’ve found it doesn’t make sense to cook at home anymore, aside for the occasional novelty of it. Ever since finding a local food service (which charges us $10 per person per home-cooked paleo/organic/healthy meal it delivers), it’s been hard to justify spending more money for the ingredients alone, before doing the same amount of work ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-capital-h-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting&#34;&gt;The capital-H Health Benefits™ of Intermittent Fasting®&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546413&#34;&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2622429/&#34;&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0104423013000213&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://easacademy.org/trainer-resources/article/intermittent-fasting&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; into what’s called “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting&#34;&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href=&#34;http://authoritynutrition.com/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/&#34;&gt;its&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295914.php&#34;&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webmd.com/diet/is_fasting_healthy&#34;&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/06/23/reaping-the-health-benefits-of-fasting-without-actually-fasting/#7fc639dd1e3b&#34;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; for everything from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/01/12/376712920/minifasting-how-occasionally-skipping-meals-may-boost-health&#34;&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; (duh) to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2015/07/03/intermittent-fasting-cancer-treatment.aspx&#34;&gt;curing cancer&lt;/a&gt; (ooh!). Does &lt;a href=&#34;http://dailyburn.com/life/health/intermittent-fasting-methods/&#34;&gt;what I do qualify&lt;/a&gt;? Am I passively &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myhealthwire.com/news/breakthroughs/924&#34;&gt;curing myself of pre-detection stage-1 cancer&lt;/a&gt; without realizing it? Am I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-29/fasting-at-least-twice-a-week-seen-as-alzheimer-s-hedge&#34;&gt;guarding myself against Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’d be great to learn that I’m doing myself long-term health favors, but I can only confidently report on my direct observations. My back, which was in near-constant pain before, is now completely asymptomatic. I don’t get sick often (relative to how much I travel and for being married to a teacher), and when I do get sick, the symptoms are typically less severe than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This smells a little too much like folk logic, but it feels truthy so I’ll share it: fasting long enough for blood sugar levels to substantially decrease might result in more cells undergoing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis&#34;&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt;, especially cancerous cells enjoying unhibited growth in a glucose-rich environment. Since their ability to regulate cell division is encumbered, so too, the thinking goes, that their ability to survive in glucose-poor environments might also be impaired. Ergo, routine fasting might prevent some forms of cancer. &lt;strong&gt;[CITATION NEEDED]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it seems to be doing great for my health, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#ymmv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;should-i-try-the-searls-fasting-exercise-system&#34;&gt;Should I try the @searls fasting + exercise system?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no opinion on whether this is for everyone, or for you in particular. What I do think is worth everyone’s time, however, is to question the assumptions we all grew up with. As more and more companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://testdouble.com&#34;&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt; support relatively autonomous and asynchronous remote work, we’re now free to experiment with a lot of the social norms handed to us, and too few people are taking advantage of that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d challenge anyone to introspect why they wake, work, and sleep when they do, as well as which activities they choose to fill their day. White collar workers in developed countries are currently enjoying an explosion in acceptable lifestyle approaches that we haven’t seen since at least the industrial revolution, if not the beginning of the feudal age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about starting &lt;a href=&#34;http://testdouble.com&#34;&gt;Test Double&lt;/a&gt; has been to see the creative optimizations our agents have made in their own lives. Some have replaced their commute with the routine of taking their kids to school every day. Some have started working hours which enable them to provide better care of loved ones. Others have done the yeoman’s work of figuring out how to work effectively while living life on the road, divorced from any traditional housing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether I can recruit others to fast and run everyday like I do doesn’t seem nearly as interesting as coaxing people to think hard about what abnormal things they might start doing in order to live the life they really want to live. If you ever need help figuring that out for yourself, I’m happy to help and not &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;hard to get ahold of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As an American that’s regularly traveled to Japan over the past ten years — in trips ranging from 2 weeks to 7 months — I’ve accumulated a few observations and tips that have made getting around significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;travel-light&#34;&gt;Travel Light&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I travel with a carry-onable back pack. Anything larger would be obnoxious when negotiating trains/bus stations. Specifically, I travel with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/837012/osprey-porter-46-travel-pack&#34;&gt;Osprey Porter 46&lt;/a&gt;. Even with that, I usually plan my day around dropping it off as quickly as possible (even if it’s prior to check-in, hotels will always hold it for you). Large, hard-shell rolling luggage is popular in Japan but since they’re probably only taking it straight to the airport or back, the same strategy wouldn’t make much sense for touring Japan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever need to ditch your bag before arriving at wherever you‘re staying, search any major train station for coin lockers large enough to cram it in (coin lockers are typically deceptively deep and spacious). Typically, you insert your bag first (to ensure it fits), then insert coins to engage the lock and release the key. Increasingly, coin lockers are going digital, able to break change or pay with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICOCA&#34;&gt;ICOCA&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suica&#34;&gt;SUICA&lt;/a&gt; and alert you to other locker locations with vacancy, often printing a claim receipt with a keycode to unlock your locker with. All coin locker payments are per-use, so once you unlock your bag, you’d need to pay to use it again. If you can’t find a bay of coin lockers, try asking a station employee: “コインロッカーはありますか？(coin-row-kah wa ah-ree-mahs ka?)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bring-cash&#34;&gt;Bring Cash&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan on carrying plenty of cash. Credit cards aren’t as ubiquitous in Japan as they are in most of the Western world, and smaller businesses often refuse them as a result. Chains and major retail outlets will almost always accept credit, however (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are usually accepted in similar proportion to the US). I typically withdraw money every few days while I’m in the country and default to using cash and awkwardly slowing down transactions as I fumble to count coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re in the country, the best place to use an ATM is, strangely enough, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_%26_I_Holdings_Co.&#34;&gt;7–11&lt;/a&gt;. Because one of the 7 &amp;amp; i holdings conglomerate’s subsidiaries is a bank, they always have international ATMs that can read mag-stripe Visa &amp;amp; Mastercard debit cards. They even publish an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sevenbank.co.jp/english/personal/atm/app/&#34;&gt;augmented reality app&lt;/a&gt; to help you find 7–11 ATms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in an area without a bevvy of 7–11 convenience stores, you can also use the ATM or exchange currency at a Japanese post office (you’ll stumble over them if you look for the 〒 symbol on signs or ask ”郵便局はどこですか？” (phoenetically: ‘you-bean-kyoku wa doko dess ka?’). ATMs at Japanese Post offices are always international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;passport-safety&#34;&gt;Passport / Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traveling in Japan is almost eerily, worrisomely safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, however, if you’re traveling Japan as a tourist on a 90-day visa and don’t have a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_registration_in_Japan&#34;&gt;Gaijin card&lt;/a&gt;”, you’re required to be able to furnish your passport at all times, even — technically — if you’re going for a jog or in a public bath. As you might imagine, this is highly impractical and I regularly leave my passport locked in my hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like some horror stories to scare you into carrying your passport everywhere you go, you might check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debito.org/?page_id=506&#34;&gt;Arudou Debito’s homepage&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese law gives wide latitude to Japan’s justice system when dealing with foreigners, but in practice attention and arrests are vanishingly rare compared to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;trains&#34;&gt;Trains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always purchase &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.japanrailpass.net/eng/en001.html&#34;&gt;Japan Rail Passes&lt;/a&gt;, which allow unlimited 7 (or 14 or 21) day access to most of the nation’s railways. Acquiring these is confusing but not difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passes cannot be purchased by Japanese nationals and they must be paid for &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the country. What you purchase (again, while still outside Japan) is a notarized &lt;em&gt;exchange voucher&lt;/em&gt; from a travel agency (I recommend looking for an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iace-usa.com/&#34;&gt;IACE&lt;/a&gt; storefront, but you can also purchase them online). Virtually any Japanese tourist agency office can sell you an exchange voucher on the spot, but you must present your passport and make sure the name matches the passport exactly. (I had to beg and plead that “Becky” and “Rebecca” were equivalent a few years back). More details &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you arrive in Japan, find the first Japan Rail (JR) office and ask to exchange the voucher for a rail pass there — they’ll direct you to a station or office that issues them. They’re not cheap ($300 or so per person for a 14 day ticket), but if you plan on riding any bullet trains (as you ought to if you’re going from Tokyo to Kyoto and Osaka and back), it’ll almost certainly pay for itself. Simply present it (displaying the expiration date outwardly) at any JR turnstile to an attendant and they’ll wave you through. It works for the bullet trains, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for several newer Shinkansen lines such as the “Nozomi” line (you can usually weed those out with English signage). Also, don’t bother buying the expensive “Green car” variation, as few trains you ride will feature green cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that a Rail Pass won’t cover every train in the country, and it usually won’t cover bus fare. Most large cities’ subway infratructure isn’t operated by JR, so those fairs (usually $2–3 a ride) aren’t coveregd by the pass. Also, keep in mind that some trains must be reserved in advance (at no additional cost if you carry a Rail Pass), like the N’EX connector between Narita and Tokyo, which any ticket sales attendant can reserve for you if you show them your pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ticket-machines&#34;&gt;Ticket Machines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t get a rail pass or if you’re riding a private rail line (or subway or bus), most ticket centers have at least one terminal that’ll have an english button somewhere on it. When you’re in Osaka/Kyoto, someone will probably offer to help you, because unlike in Tokyo, people are typically nice and gregarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure is usually something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the huge printed map for your destination and find out how many yen the fare is (the number labeled near the station name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter enough cash into the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the quantity and fare needed to cover the travel to your intended destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;train-schedules&#34;&gt;Train Schedules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In urban centers and on subways, the platform you want is typically more important than the schedule, because trains run so frequently that most people will just wait for the whenever the next one comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tricky parts to train schedules in Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many lines share commuter, express, “super express” rapid train services, so if your destination is less popular, it’s possible to board a super rapid line and zip past your destination, requiring you to backtrack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JR trains start winding down service at midnight, and it’s not uncommon to find oneself stranded when going out late; typically the only remedy is an (expensive) taxi or to wait around until 5am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out when and where to transfer trains can sometimes be confusing, especially on local private train lines; if your destination is unclear it’s usually smart to ask an attendant at the gate how to get to your destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperdia-by-voice/id379001449?mt=8&#34;&gt;Hyperdia iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; for figuring out any complex train itineraries. Google Maps’ transit directions work fine, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, just ask. Typically, if you ask an employee “I want to go to ___” and look confused enough, they’ll stay with you as long as necessary to help you out. LIkewise, if you’re on a train and need to know if the station you’re arriving at is your exit (or change), just point at the door and ask the name of your destination to literally anyone around you and they’ll probably understand your intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occassionally, commuter trains in Japan will announce the next stop is the end of the line (“終点 / shoe-ten”). If you witness every single human get off the train simultaneously, it’s typically a smart strategy to exit as well, and follow the mob to whatever train they board next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;internet-access&#34;&gt;Internet Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s renowned wireless network is very solid. Accesing it can be tricky, depending on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you carry a locked phone, it can’t hurt to call your carrier and request an unlock in advance of your travel. If you can’t avoid the fact that your phone is locked and you don’t want to pay extravagant data roaming charges, you could consider renting a mobile hotspot. One service that offers rental hot spots to tourists is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pupuru.com/en/service/emobile/&#34;&gt;PuPuRu&lt;/a&gt;, and I had a pleasant enough experience with them in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do have an unlocked phone, I strongly recommend you drop by an electronics store and look for a data-only SIM. I documented this in a separate &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@searls/how-to-internet-in-japan-ba48fe421fa0&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for wifi, free public wifi is relatively rare in Japan. There are tons of hotspots in public spaces, but many of them tie back to residential ISP service and require authentication. There’s an interesting workaround to this, by way of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/japan-connected-free-wi-fi/id810838196?mt=8&#34;&gt;app for tourists designed to unlock countless wifi hotspots&lt;/a&gt;, published by NTT, Japan’s largest telecom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many hotels are still not equipped with wifi, but &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; provide wired connections over ethernet. As a result, I’ll typically travel with an ethernet adapter for my computer or an Airport Express to create a wifi hotspot for my hotel room whenever wifi isn’t provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;booking-hotels&#34;&gt;Booking hotels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booking hotels in Japan in English is almost as easy as any Western country, and resellers like Booking can be looked up through just about any TripAdvisor review. Keep in mind, however, that a large proportion of Japanese hotels aren’t listed on any third-party booking sites. To get access to a few more listings, you might check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/&#34;&gt;Jalan’s english site&lt;/a&gt;, which is filtered down to hotels that ceritfy they have English-language ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In large cities, getting an apartment to yourself via Airbnb can also be a good option. The real-estate market in Japan has been suffering a slow descent as the population has declined and inventory keeps outstripping demand, which means apartments are relatively cheap, and as a result even very nice luxury apartments on Airbnb are pretty affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in an urban area without a place to stay for an evening (or you accidentally stayed someplace after the trains shut down), you might be able to find some rest at an internet/manga cafe, which are often equipped with showers, lockers, and rooms with sofas. At a few bucks an hour, they can make for an extremely cheap hotel substitute in a pinch&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing a Content Blocker on iOS 9 Public Beta</title>
      <link>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/installing-a-content-blocker-on-ios-9-public-beta-a25b2b83848f/</link>

      <guid>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/installing-a-content-blocker-on-ios-9-public-beta-a25b2b83848f/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending 3 weeks abroad, literally afraid of opening anything resembling an article in Safari, I was eager to come home, install a beta operating system, and take advantage of iOS 9&#39;s now-famous content blocking API. There are a few projects on GitHub that do this, but the most evolved seems to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty&#34;&gt;Block Party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try out installing a content blocker on an iPhone for ourselves. The instructions below are mostly complete and a bit inane, so it’s up to you whether you’re better off just waiting the 4–6 weeks until iOS 9 is released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there are some pre-requisites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install iOS 9 beta; I’m using Public Beta 3 from &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/redemption#ios&#34;&gt;beta.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/&#34;&gt;Xcode 7&lt;/a&gt; onto a Mac (requires dev account)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty/archive/master.zip&#34;&gt;download a ZIP&lt;/a&gt; of the BlockParty &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these in place, it’s time to open BlockParty.xcodeproj&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qtay-KEjtm4ObOi-w45-fA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time launching Xcode, you’ll need to first let it install additional components, then switch the target from an iPhone 6 simulator (the default) to an iOS device, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FadvailpPrgwAoKAqX6mEA.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, plug in your iPhone and its name and model icon should replace the generic “iOS Device” label:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K5yc5fUzfkYrontoedI4jg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, press Run (the familiar “Play” icon at the top-left) and you’ll be prompted whether or not you’d like to enable Developer Mode on the Mac (it’s up to you, and shouldn’t be necessary for the purpose of this task).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably be greeted with an error that your phone is still processing symbol files, as shown below. Just wait it out until it’s completed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DLFQglTtMWrRDMeCPE-UPg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s finally ready, click Run again to see the next error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NsVD9RAOqmFXvPlbNqpbiQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve this, first click “Fix Issue”, which will prompt you to log in to your Apple ID (you no longer need to be a member of a paid developer account, but you do need to be logged in to generate the necessary provisioning profile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try again, you’ll get a similar error because these App IDs are reserved by the author of the repo. You’ll need to set your own; to do so, start by clicking the project in the left and change the bundle IDs of both targets “BlockParty” and “RediffBlock” to something unique. Here I just replaced his domain name with “com.github.searls”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t-3O9JlZjPKB06iQFE4zaw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Bundle ID you enter needs to be registered with Apple, which Xcode can do for you by pressing the “Fix Issue” button in the same editor pane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*324IyWER6lgHhuMgodqIkA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you click Run, you should get all the way through installing the app. The failure you see next will be a generic failure with only the message “Security”. This is because iOS 9 requires user input on the device to explicitly trust each developer that’s loaded apps onto the it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, on the phone, jump into Settings -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Profiles and select your Apple ID under “Developer Profiles”, then tap the “Trust” link and subsequent confirmation dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, launch the “BlockParty” app from your home screen so that it can register itself to iOS as providing a content blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Settings -&amp;gt; Safari -&amp;gt; Content Blockers, you’ll see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AdxRFxfODcYSsX3TKkAXKQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable it, and you should be able to test in Safari by seeing fewer popover ads appear at a site like &lt;a href=&#34;http://imore.com&#34;&gt;iMore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://theverge.com&#34;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, wasn’t that simple!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Internet in Japan</title>
      <link>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/how-to-internet-in-japan-ba48fe421fa0/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, then perhaps you enjoy having fast, easy access to the Internet. If so, and you’re heading to Japan anytime soon, then perhaps this guide will be of use to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When traveling to Japan, access to their mostly-excellent wireless network is not always easily attained. In the past, I’ve used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html&#34;&gt;T-Mobile’s free unlimited international roaming&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pupuru.com/en/&#34;&gt;mobile hotspot rental services&lt;/a&gt;, but both have significant drawbacks — extreme throttling and terrible battery life, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I’ll document a much more convenient way to get Internet access, by way of purchasing a prepaid data-only SIM card. First, a few prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An unlocked phone that can join international GSM networks (this guide covers my use of an iPhone 6, but virtually any GSM smartphone is supported)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The means to make your way to the first floor of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yodobashi.com&#34;&gt;Yodobashi camera&lt;/a&gt;, though other electronics stores (“Denkiya-san”) may work as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Somewhat ironically) an Internet connection, to download a configuration profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughly $35&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;buying-a-card&#34;&gt;Buying a card&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask a Yodobashi sales representative for a “data SIM”, they should point you to the mobile phone area, and then to an endcap of SIM cards which are designed for use by foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind — and they’ll probably warn you this straightaway — that these cards may not be used for calls or texts (this is by design, and meant to comply with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Japan&#34;&gt;2006 law prohibiting foreign visitors from buying SIM cards capable of making phone calls&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for which to buy, the best known among these is probably &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/english/product.html&#34;&gt;B-Mobile’s Visitor SIM&lt;/a&gt;, but I think I’ve found one that’s a significantly better deal: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.iijmio.jp/en/index.html&#34;&gt;IIJmio Japan Travel SIM&lt;/a&gt;. The product itself will probably be held behind the counter, and it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*a9clsEnj0itXM0FwzOCkaw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;a 2GB, 3 Month Nano SIM (Micro and Regular SIM sizes also available)&#34; /&gt;
a 2GB, 3 Month Nano SIM (Micro and Regular SIM sizes also available)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, 4000 yen (about $35) will buy you a card with an initial allowance of 2GB on Docomo’s LTE network (serviced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iijmio.jp&#34;&gt;IIJmio&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator&#34;&gt;MVNO&lt;/a&gt; of Japan’s largest carrier, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/&#34;&gt;Docomo&lt;/a&gt;). In contrast, the B-Mobile SIM expires after only 14 days, is limited to 1GB of access, cannot be recharged, and is yet offered for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-up-the-card&#34;&gt;Setting up the card&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, use of this SIM card requires custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201699&#34;&gt;APN settings&lt;/a&gt; which cannot be edited manually on an iPhone by the user. As a result, before connecting to the cellular network, you must first attain Internet access by some other means; if you find a savvy Yodobashi employee, they’ll be able to point you to the Tax Free information counter, which I’m told can provide free WiFi to foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have Internet access, visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iijmio.jp/hdd/devices/config.jsp&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; (search for “iijmio apn”) from your mobile device and then tap the big pink button halfway down the page, pictured here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*avTpKt4vXKKmlG-Lqkzdrw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install an (unsigned! Argh!) configuration profile to your phone which enables access to the Docomo network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discarding the packaging, take note of the &lt;strong&gt;telephone number&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;pass code&lt;/strong&gt; written on the card that houses the SIM, because they will be necessary for accessing IIJmio’s support site and adding more data to your account later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aqkYEYFP9c4_rhQNeye9ow.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, popping in the SIM will enable access to the LTE network at the same speeds afforded to full-fledged subscribers. Not only is the network fast, but (aside from the aforementioned lack of phone &amp;amp; SMS support) it comes without any obvious reservations or limitations. For example, tethering my connection to my MacBook worked perfectly well — something that I haven’t seen in data-only SIMs targeted at tourists in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;adding-more-data-to-the-sim&#34;&gt;Adding more data to the SIM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why I like this SIM is that it can be recharged with more data somewhat conveniently for up to 3 months — if you activate in July, you’ll have until the end of the third full month (October) to use it without worrying about replacing the SIM card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add more data to the SIM by buying an IIJmio data card from nearly any &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lawson.co.jp/index.html&#34;&gt;Lawson convenience store&lt;/a&gt;; it’ll probably be located along with other gift cards and digital currency cards. The refill cards look like this and run about 3000 yen ($25) for 2GB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aNcsGzPtxZyQySN8S_-tkQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cards have a scratch-off “coupon code” on the back, which can be used at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.iijmio.jp/s/&#34;&gt;IIJmio support site&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that Lawson will probably decline the use of a credit card to purchase the card, so be sure to have sufficient cash on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To redeem the card, head to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.iijmio.jp/s/&#34;&gt;support site&lt;/a&gt; and login using the &lt;strong&gt;telephone number&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;pass code&lt;/strong&gt; that was printed on the card that held the SIM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hufUSXWgxL1SXiLyOa8inA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve logged in, you’ll see the allowance you’ve used so far, as well as a link to enter your coupon code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cMNVITacbxa2OPP2sNvZTw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, scratch off your refill card and enter the coupon code on the bottom of the next page before continuing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*COksE_kbDEYLXDexFG88Hw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will bring you to a confirmation page. Check the box to agree to the terms of service and tap Apply to finish the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B3T0E8tNBUUt6UJWPGcPIw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;お疲れ様でした-good-job&#34;&gt;お疲れ様でした (Good Job!)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to think, this is the &lt;em&gt;incredibly easy&lt;/em&gt; means of getting mobile data set up for oneself in Japan. Compared to my trips 3, 6, and 10 years ago, this process has been a revelation of convenience. And it’s not too expensive when compared to other options, either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this guide helps you prepare for your trip to Japan or otherwise reduces your stress level as you plan for how you’ll get online once you’re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in other tips for traveling to Japan, I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/searls/4561407&#34;&gt;gisted some here&lt;/a&gt;. 頑張ってください！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re a million million worlds. All different and all similar. Constants and variables. -Elizabeth, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite&#34;&gt;Bioshock Infinite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesson I learned early in my career as a programmer was to be wary of accidental creativity. If you’re the type of person who really cares about getting the details right, it’s critical to first decide which details truly matter. Not doing so is a recipe for endless frustration, as one will inevitably be distracted and defeated each day — sweating more arbitrary decisions than meaningful ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a bunch of prior art on this point, from studies on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice&#34;&gt;paradox of choice&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion&#34;&gt;cognitive depletion&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cultofmac.com/122575/why-steve-jobs-wore-turtlenecks/&#34;&gt;Steve Jobs turtleneck lore&lt;/a&gt;. It’s pretty intuitive, after all, that eliminating routine decisions should free up energy for our brains to do other (presumably more valuable) things. However, we tend not to see many interesting examples of the types of constants people set for themselves. And even more importantly, there is rarely discussion on the aspects of our lives that people might intentionally keep variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ll go first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constants&#34;&gt;Constants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a bunch of examples of things in my life that I’ve decided to keep uninteresting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When reading a restaurant menu, I’ll tend to choose the more unusual of any two offerings. Any place that sells pizza is obligated to offer pepperoni, regardless of whether theirs is any good. Meanwhile, it’d only make sense that they’d offer a potato crisp and taleggio cheese pizza if it was somehow great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I own about twenty of the same $5.95 basic H&amp;amp;M shirt, thirty identical pairs of white socks, the same type of New Balance sneakers I’ve worn for 15 years, and a few pairs of jeans; I’ve also given up any hope of styling my receding hair. I spend approximately thirty seconds per day thinking about my appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I can afford it, I always keep one of each category of the latest Apple devices. The convenience of ecosystem lock-in eliminates a lot of useless friction, plus their hardware retains its resell value so well that I usually only spend 15% to upgrade to the latest device. Frequent upgrades also help guard against overly-customized configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents blessed me with a set of genes that will see me constantly gain weight unless I pay close attention to it. To counteract my nature, I force myself to run exactly 20 minutes at 8 miles per hour on a treadmill every day (with only one or two exceptions per year). I also don’t eat until the sun sets each day, meaning I skip breakfast, lunch, and daytime snacking. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/searls&#34;&gt;Ask me anything&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When choosing between visiting any two points of interest, I’ll default to the one I haven’t tried yet or the one I’ve been to least recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I buy a videogame, I give myself express permission to declare bankruptcy on the backlog of hundreds of unfinished games I’ve bought previously. Life’s stressful enough without spending my free time being mired in guilt over sunk entertainment costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When packing for a trip, if I’m not sure whether I’ll need something, I simply don’t bring it. I’d rather be mildly inconvenienced by not having something than find myself lugging around things I don’t need. Besides, in most countries, I can buy whatever it is I’d be missing when I get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of travel, I always use the same bag (a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/837012/osprey-porter-46-travel-pack&#34;&gt;46L Osprey Porter&lt;/a&gt;), no matter how many days or weeks I’ll be away. I always carry it on, too; checking a bag wastes time and risks loss on both ends, and I never want to possess more than I can comfortably carry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When comparing two similar places to stay or live, I always pick the newer building. Old buildings are generally annoyance factories, while new ones are typically more convenient. Besides, I’ll have moved on before the shoddiness of modern construction causes the building to crumble around me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As much as I’d rather be at home watching Netflix or playing video games, when someone asks me to travel somewhere to speak to an audience, I default to saying yes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/toddkaufman&#34;&gt;Todd&lt;/a&gt; and I try to verify it’ll be worth my and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://testdouble.com&#34;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;’s time, but it’s hard not to see that innumerable good outcomes in my life have been the direct result of becoming comfortable with the discomfort of travelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;variables&#34;&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rigidity of the above constants buys me some extra mental energy every day. So, how do I spend it? And what aspects of my life are at risk of incidental constancy, when I’d be better off if I were to &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; they remain variable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are things I’m happy to let float freely in my life, only taking action to unstick myself in the event that they don’t change often enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of software I write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which friends I surround myself with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of entertainment I seek out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of industries I work in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where I live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What time I wake up, where I get my work done, when I am productive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether I eat healthily — I take too much joy in novel food choices to eat only what &lt;a href=&#34;http://michaelpollan.com/reviews/just-eat-what-your-great-grandma-ate/&#34;&gt;my grandmother would recognize as food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What proportion of my time each day I spend creating versus talking versus thinking versus relaxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspects of our lives we keep variable should be the things that really matter to us, because it’s novelty that drives creativity and uncertainty which evokes meaning. If you spend any time reflecting on this post, start by asking which variables you keep. My fear is too many of my friends are stuck with these priorities in reverse: their life’s work reduced to a grind of constancy and their life’s variability consumed by inane details they’ll care little about later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my good days, my main motivation is to leave behind some kind of useful message to others that will last for a time, even after I’ve gone. My hope is that everyone feels that way and we each find our own means to accomplish it. Good luck! 😁&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When I’m trying to read my iPhone (or iPad) in bed, I’m liable to wake up my spouse with the device’s backlight, even when the screen is set to its lowest brightness setting. Moreover, it’s hard for me to fall asleep immediately after staring at a relatively bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/searls/status/561462319407177728&#34;&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt; I thought I was just out of luck unless I &lt;a href=&#34;https://justgetflux.com/ios.html&#34;&gt;installed flux&lt;/a&gt;, which would never be worth the security and stability issues raised by jailbreaking a device. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&#34;http://olivierlacan.com&#34;&gt;Olivier Lacan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/olivierlacan/status/561462435522310144&#34;&gt;commiserated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/olivierlacan/status/561462810249822208&#34;&gt;relayed a tip&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone’s accessibility settings can be lightly abused to decrease the strength of the backlight below its lowest setting. (We’ve known the hardware is capable of this given that iBooks has &lt;a href=&#34;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2391777&#34;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45885/ability-to-set-even-below-the-minimum-brightness-on-ipad&#34;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipad.bigresource.com/System-wide-Brightness-dimmer-AciXfEeOk.html&#34;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/toggle-your-iphones-brightness-with-a-home-button-trip-1651329242&#34;&gt;Lifehacker guide&lt;/a&gt; Olivier linked was a bit hard-to-follow, I figured I’d help by illustrating a how-to do this with a few GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-do-it&#34;&gt;How to do it&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Zoom, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oaJ29Ht6MaK-VFkB6DEcbg.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, toggle Zoom on, then do a very fancy &lt;em&gt;triple tap with 3-fingers.&lt;/em&gt; This will bring up a translucent modal configuration overlay. From this overlay, tap “Choose Filter” then “Low Light”. Finally, drag the Zoom slider all the way out, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*miNVJJkFoucJo8Hzq_EvUw.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The “Low Light” feature is what sets the hardware brightness dimmer than the setting allows, while zooming out completely will prevent the “Zoom” feature from actually, you know, &lt;em&gt;zooming&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, tap away from the modal, then tap “Zoom Region” and select “Full Screen Zoom”, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3F0d5SeuceENUpzSfaGGXQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&lt;/strong&gt;, go back to the top-level Accessibility settings, scroll down, and assign the “Accessibility Shortcut” to “Zoom”, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i3ISnxnCkIaeS9djIGH2QQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;huzzah&#34;&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you triple-tap the home button you’ll see your screen dim to previously undimmable levels of dimness. To return to the default settings, just triple-click your home button again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a comparison with two photos — one taken at minimum brightness and one shot with Zoom enabled after being configured with the above instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*glX2gIbcP9kkVeSclc3aIQ.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s a significant difference when you’re in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this guide helps you when your setting calls for an even-dimmer-than-dim setting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studying Japanese with a Nintendo 3DS &amp; Google Translate</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in using videogames to practice my Japanese reading and listening comprehension, so after some initial thinking, I decided to buy an imported New Nintendo 3DS. Here are some notes on how I went about that and what I’m doing to use games primarily as an educational tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;buying-the-device&#34;&gt;Buying the device&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of import sites out there that will get you a good deal on Japanese game products, but I wanted to (a) get fast, reliable shipping, (b) have some kind of return policy, and (c) not risk customs headaches. As a result, I decided to buy the device off Amazon’s US site from a third-party merchant using Fulfillment by Amazon so that I could get Amazon Prime shipping and Amazon support for returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up purchasing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NAW5R0I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00NAW5R0I&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=justinsearls-20&amp;amp;linkId=U6TC6FH2UPQ5A55A&#34;&gt;this model (Amazon referral link)&lt;/a&gt; and then hunted for an Amazon Prime-able merchant under the sellers list, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JuHRiSCh6fI8I_F48gtl7A.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I picked up a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1BoFQV0&#34;&gt;64GB SDXC card (Amazon referral link)&lt;/a&gt; and formatted it to FAT32 using Mac OS X’s Disk Utility (here’s an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmIanMx1HDM&#34;&gt;instructional video&lt;/a&gt; if you’re not familiar with how to do this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-up-the-device&#34;&gt;Setting up the device&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two days (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekwire.com/2014/amazon-getting-packages-sunday-via-u-s-postal-service/&#34;&gt;on a Sunday, no less&lt;/a&gt;), the package arrived:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6o8CmcmS8tcAeahISdxCkQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5HH1Z3R1fjUhTZtes3ry6w.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After unpacking it, I unscrewed and detached the rear faceplate to eject the built-in 4GB SDHC card to replace it with my larger one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2B_Tuo8a6Z988CVjKIiNyg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;The rear face plate (it ships attached)&#34; /&gt;
The rear face plate (it ships attached)&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*C39htKeFFULdsnorJQ2u-g.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;How things look when the faceplate is removed.&#34; /&gt;
How things look when the faceplate is removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first boot up the system, you’re taken through a somewhat extraordinarily long (and independently educational, if you’re not an advanced Japanese speaker) setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;translating-text&#34;&gt;Translating text&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the reason I went with the 3DS as opposed to using my Playstation Vita was because of the plethora of text-heavy content that’s targeted at all-ages on Nintendo platforms (whereas Vita users skew older and the hardware enables more real-time cutscenes that don’t pause and allow a reader to move at their own pace). Similarly, I chose not to use an iOS device because I wanted to be able to use my own iPhone as a translation and flashcard storage tool without switching away from the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly nifty translation aid that was only just &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yahoo.com/tech/with-newest-app-google-aims-to-be-your-universal-108083039354.html&#34;&gt;released this week&lt;/a&gt; is the latest iteration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8&#34;&gt;Google’s Translate iOS app (iTunes link)&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the photo-scanning option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, consider a text-heavy screen like this (taken from the wizard, but it could just as well be a game):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i-PyfN8zI3HJKT08cGzHag.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whether I was playing with a 3DS, a Vita, or an iOS device, in the context of a game, text information will almost always be effectively rasterized (e.g. not selectable and searchable) without the help of traditional Kanji lookup tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you bring up the Google Translate app on a phone and tap the camera icon (after selecting that you’re translating from Japanese into English), you’ll be greeted by this image scanning UI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*laB8_wqC1_SR0RE1D-FHRA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just align the text as best you can, focus, and leave some room at the margins so you’re not too crowded by the app’s UI controls. Then click “scan” and every recognized character will be outlined in a little white rectangle. Simply smudge your finger over the characters you’d like to translate (forming complete clauses or sentences is obviously best) and the app will translate your selection, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*P7h8R5Uqh63N3JU-cie3wQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you’d like to see the native Japanese text (so you can select, copy/paste, search definitions, etc.), simply click the blue arrow to be brought to the familiar Google Translate interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j95N-x_35Vp7mobgovpeYA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose I was curious what “画面” meant. Now I can select it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2Z6lpCuhLwEZU0eXnScThw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tap “Define” to get the definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EuEv5b6FybRlUxchHys00Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;(If you see “No Definitions Found”, you’ll need to Tap “&amp;lt; Dictionary”, then download the “Japanese &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; English” dictionary and try again.)&#34; /&gt;
(If you see “No Definitions Found”, you’ll need to Tap “&amp;lt; Dictionary”, then download the “Japanese &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; English” dictionary and try again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final step is to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stickystudy-flash-flashcards/id485219719?mt=8&#34;&gt;StickyStudy’s Flascard app (iTunes Link)&lt;/a&gt; to add the term to a custom flashcard deck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Gt7IaO3iIodtBB54LAwf1g.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, I can sate my immediate curiosity and immediately move on, knowing I won’t lose track of that term I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;game-on&#34;&gt;Game on!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this post might encourage a few other Japanese learners to try this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I lived in Japan in 2005, I bought some Japanese Nintendo DS games and found myself craning my neck constantly as I oscillated between the device and my traditional dictionary. I did learn a few things, but it took me hours to get through even a basic in-game conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that translation and study tools have improved well enough that I’ll have more luck this time for successfully using games as an efficient language acquisition tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;頑張ってね！&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will your iPad’s Apple SIM allow you to buy ala carte prepaid data from AT&amp;T?</title>

      <guid>https://justin.searls.co/posts/searls/will-your-ipads-apple-sim-allow-you-to-buy-ala-carte-prepaid-data-from-at-t-da673e1d3c16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Apple announced iPad Air 2, I was most excited by the prospect of Apple SIM. That excitement waned when we learned AT&amp;amp;T would lock Apple SIMs to its network upon their activation (so much for that layer of indirection enabling competition). Still, I held out hope that maybe an Apple SIM could be used to purchase pre-paid data from an iPad and then be plopped into and used by an unlocked iPhone 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how that went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I picked out a “1GB for 3 Months” pay-as-you-go plan from AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rbrw1J9NgeFRn9SDpoYxuA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. I chuckled at the thought of this horrible typography living inside of a scrolling view inside of a navigation controller inside of a modal view on top of a master-detail view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E5FMipiAg2HGSQflyA768Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. I entered my credit card (not shown, forgot to take a screenshot of my credit card) and voila: activated on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xZjhdWqfdxJPjuu0DZpENA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. I immediately popped the Apple SIM out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xFKOFw-G2soMSX9-q7Lvvw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. I transferred the Apple SIM to my unlocked iPhone 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7_yqdI3YIxmCHfLJm7dtzA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. I tapped “OK”, as if that was going to help me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
