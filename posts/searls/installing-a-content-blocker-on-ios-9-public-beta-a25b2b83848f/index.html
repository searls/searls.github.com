    <h1>Installing a Content Blocker on iOS 9 Public Beta</h1>
    <p>After spending 3 weeks abroad, literally afraid of opening anything resembling an article in Safari, I was eager to come home, install a beta operating system, and take advantage of iOS 9's now-famous content blocking API. There are a few projects on GitHub that do this, but the most evolved seems to be <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty">Block Party</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s try out installing a content blocker on an iPhone for ourselves. The instructions below are mostly complete and a bit inane, so it’s up to you whether you’re better off just waiting the 4–6 weeks until iOS 9 is released to the public.</p>

<p>First, there are some pre-requisites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install iOS 9 beta; I’m using Public Beta 3 from <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/redemption#ios">beta.apple.com</a></li>
<li>Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">Xcode 7</a> onto a Mac (requires dev account)</li>
<li>Clone or <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty/archive/master.zip">download a ZIP</a> of the BlockParty <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty">repo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With these in place, it’s time to open BlockParty.xcodeproj</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qtay-KEjtm4ObOi-w45-fA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If this is your first time launching Xcode, you’ll need to first let it install additional components, then switch the target from an iPhone 6 simulator (the default) to an iOS device, like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FadvailpPrgwAoKAqX6mEA.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>After this, plug in your iPhone and its name and model icon should replace the generic “iOS Device” label:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K5yc5fUzfkYrontoedI4jg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next, press Run (the familiar “Play” icon at the top-left) and you’ll be prompted whether or not you’d like to enable Developer Mode on the Mac (it’s up to you, and shouldn’t be necessary for the purpose of this task).</p>

<p>You’ll probably be greeted with an error that your phone is still processing symbol files, as shown below. Just wait it out until it’s completed:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DLFQglTtMWrRDMeCPE-UPg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When it’s finally ready, click Run again to see the next error:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NsVD9RAOqmFXvPlbNqpbiQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To resolve this, first click “Fix Issue”, which will prompt you to log in to your Apple ID (you no longer need to be a member of a paid developer account, but you do need to be logged in to generate the necessary provisioning profile).</p>

<p>If you try again, you’ll get a similar error because these App IDs are reserved by the author of the repo. You’ll need to set your own; to do so, start by clicking the project in the left and change the bundle IDs of both targets “BlockParty” and “RediffBlock” to something unique. Here I just replaced his domain name with “com.github.searls”</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t-3O9JlZjPKB06iQFE4zaw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each Bundle ID you enter needs to be registered with Apple, which Xcode can do for you by pressing the “Fix Issue” button in the same editor pane:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*324IyWER6lgHhuMgodqIkA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, when you click Run, you should get all the way through installing the app. The failure you see next will be a generic failure with only the message “Security”. This is because iOS 9 requires user input on the device to explicitly trust each developer that’s loaded apps onto the it.</p>

<p>Next, on the phone, jump into Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Profiles and select your Apple ID under “Developer Profiles”, then tap the “Trust” link and subsequent confirmation dialog.</p>

<p>Next, launch the “BlockParty” app from your home screen so that it can register itself to iOS as providing a content blocker.</p>

<p>Finally, in Settings -&gt; Safari -&gt; Content Blockers, you’ll see:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AdxRFxfODcYSsX3TKkAXKQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Enable it, and you should be able to test in Safari by seeing fewer popover ads appear at a site like <a href="http://imore.com">iMore</a> or <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p>See, wasn’t that simple!</p>
