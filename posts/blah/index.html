<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
Ipsum has been the industry&rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-use-it">Why do we use it?</h3>

<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
&lsquo;Content here, content here&rsquo;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop
publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
model text, and a search for &lsquo;lorem ipsum&rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in
their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

<p>what about this you ask? I dunno.</p>

<p>here is some codes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">foo</span>(a, b)
  a <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> b
<span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span></code></pre></div>

<h3 id="where-does-it-come-from">Where does it come from?</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &ldquo;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&rdquo; (The Extremes of Good and
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
&ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&rdquo;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &ldquo;de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum&rdquo; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied
by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
