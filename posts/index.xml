      <description>what?! Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>

      <description>For years, economists have been puzzling over why, despite unprecedented technological innovation since the dawn of the Internet, productivity is flat. Really, nobody seems to know why! Look no further than this week’s news to find a consensus opinion that the just-around-the-corner cure for lagging productivity numbers is—wait for it—more technological innovation.
Productivity is a curiously-named economic measure that essentially boils down to “amount of money you generate for your employer over time.</description>

      <description>Here it is, the post that enumerates all of the ways in which remote work has turned me into a total weirdo.
For almost a decade now I’ve been working from home, enjoying the unusual freedoms—and anxieties—that it brings. If a single theme has emerged, it’s this: by default, I’m an undisciplined mess. When given the choice between short-term distractions and long-term goals, I’ll take the passing hit of instant gratification every time.</description>

      <description>[A translation of this post is available in Chinese]
Programmers often describe their ideal tools with adjectives like “powerful”, “feature-rich”, and “highly-configurable”. Few users are seen as wanting more from their computers than programmers.
This popular notion agrees with our general intuition that more capability intrinsically yields greater productivity. My lived experience suggests, however, that while capability is a prerequisite for productivity, the two hardly share a linear correlation. A dozen ways to do the same thing just results in time-wasting analysis paralysis.</description>

      <description>In seven days, it will have been ten years since the keynote to end all keynotes.
A decade hence, I’m uncomfortable with declarations that the iPhone and iOS are “mature,” however. Unlike other mature platforms that became commoditized and absorbed into daily life, smartphones have not receded into the periphery of our attention. If anything, the entire planet is more glued to their phones today than ever before. “Mature” is code for “set in stone”, and it’s my view that any device that’s able to so thoroughly capture the attention of the human race as the iPhone-era smartphone demands continuous reinvestment.</description>

      <description>First, some background I embarked on a spiritual journey this week to answer these questions: do all the developers I see switching (or threatening to switch) to Windows see something that I don’t? Has Microsoft actually turned the Windows user experience around? Is the combination of Microsoft’s hardware &amp;amp; software superior to Apple’s on the Mac?
At the heart of these questions: hope. Hope that people have placed in Microsoft’s embrace of open source, its in-house hardware design, and its broadened cross-platform support.</description>

      <description>I’ll have a lot more to say about my experiments in trying out Windows over the coming days, but as a special Christmas bonus edition, I thought I’d share the steps that were apparently required for me to register my Surface Pro 4 with Microsoft.
As I got in bed last night, I activated tablet mode for the first time and while perusing the don’t-call-it-Metro tile page, I saw an app called “Surface”.</description>

      <description>I bought a Surface Pro 4 tonight. Over the next week I’m going to share my notes on getting used to it. And over the next month I’m going to attempt to do all of my open source work from it. but tonight, I want to first comment on the state of the Mac and PC so that I can get my own initial perspective and biases on the table.</description>

      <title>How-to: Thanksgiving for Millennials</title>

      <description>My wife &amp;amp; I have been returning to my parents house for Thanksgiving every year since we graduated college. Customarily, people stop schlepping home to exploit the free labor of their parents’ holiday cheer around the time they have kids—but for a growing number of millennials who aren’t interested in bringing children into the world, this presents a dilemma: do I expect my mom to cook me turkeys until she is physically unable?</description>

      <description>It’s time we had a talk about the news.
From the first time I heard a modem chime, I’ve been on a mission to discover, curate, and editorialize as much news as possible. Over the years, I’ve written for a variety of outlets — called “web sites” at first, then “blogs” for a while, and now subsumed by the lifeless social media platforms to which we all contribute. From the mid-nineties until I graduated college, I slowly optimized this information funnel — broadening the aperture of content I could absorb each day, while tightening my own editorial voice.</description>

      <description>The degree to which we’re constantly connected via our phones is well-documented, thoroughly-researched, and intuitively understood by over a billion people. But we tend not to do much about it, because the benefits of being connected seem far more concrete than the relatively intangible benefits of being disconnected.
This week, I was forced to reckon with this in a stark enough way to convince me to take action.
Lost in Translation In the year 3 BiE (Before iPhone Era), I lived a nearly-entirely Internet-disconnected life for 7 months of adventures in Japan.</description>

      <description>I often tell people the only reason I blog or speak is to guard against having the same conversation over and over again. So, here I go again:
 The first thing I eat every day is dinner, meaning I don’t eat breakfast, lunch, or daytime snacks I run 3 miles every day, without exception. In spite of my travels taking me all over the world, I’m pretty sure I haven’t missed a run in two years  Doing these two things has improved my health considerably, saves a lot of time and money, and has improved my ability to focus on my work.</description>

      <description>As an American that’s regularly traveled to Japan over the past ten years — in trips ranging from 2 weeks to 7 months — I’ve accumulated a few observations and tips that have made getting around significantly easier.
Travel Light I travel with a carry-onable back pack. Anything larger would be obnoxious when negotiating trains/bus stations. Specifically, I travel with an Osprey Porter 46. Even with that, I usually plan my day around dropping it off as quickly as possible (even if it’s prior to check-in, hotels will always hold it for you).</description>

      <description>After spending 3 weeks abroad, literally afraid of opening anything resembling an article in Safari, I was eager to come home, install a beta operating system, and take advantage of iOS 9&amp;rsquo;s now-famous content blocking API. There are a few projects on GitHub that do this, but the most evolved seems to be Block Party.
Let’s try out installing a content blocker on an iPhone for ourselves. The instructions below are mostly complete and a bit inane, so it’s up to you whether you’re better off just waiting the 4–6 weeks until iOS 9 is released to the public.</description>

      <description>If you’re reading this, then perhaps you enjoy having fast, easy access to the Internet. If so, and you’re heading to Japan anytime soon, then perhaps this guide will be of use to you.
When traveling to Japan, access to their mostly-excellent wireless network is not always easily attained. In the past, I’ve used T-Mobile’s free unlimited international roaming as well as mobile hotspot rental services, but both have significant drawbacks — extreme throttling and terrible battery life, respectively.</description>

      <description>They’re a million million worlds. All different and all similar. Constants and variables. -Elizabeth, Bioshock Infinite
 A lesson I learned early in my career as a programmer was to be wary of accidental creativity. If you’re the type of person who really cares about getting the details right, it’s critical to first decide which details truly matter. Not doing so is a recipe for endless frustration, as one will inevitably be distracted and defeated each day — sweating more arbitrary decisions than meaningful ones.</description>

      <description>When I’m trying to read my iPhone (or iPad) in bed, I’m liable to wake up my spouse with the device’s backlight, even when the screen is set to its lowest brightness setting. Moreover, it’s hard for me to fall asleep immediately after staring at a relatively bright screen.
Up until last night I thought I was just out of luck unless I installed flux, which would never be worth the security and stability issues raised by jailbreaking a device.</description>

      <description>I was interested in using videogames to practice my Japanese reading and listening comprehension, so after some initial thinking, I decided to buy an imported New Nintendo 3DS. Here are some notes on how I went about that and what I’m doing to use games primarily as an educational tool.
Buying the device There are lots of import sites out there that will get you a good deal on Japanese game products, but I wanted to (a) get fast, reliable shipping, (b) have some kind of return policy, and &amp;copy; not risk customs headaches.</description>

      <description>When Apple announced iPad Air 2, I was most excited by the prospect of Apple SIM. That excitement waned when we learned AT&amp;amp;T would lock Apple SIMs to its network upon their activation (so much for that layer of indirection enabling competition). Still, I held out hope that maybe an Apple SIM could be used to purchase pre-paid data from an iPad and then be plopped into and used by an unlocked iPhone 6.</description>
