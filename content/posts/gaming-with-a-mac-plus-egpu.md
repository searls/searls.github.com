## How we got here

After Apple released its (soon-to-be) previous generation Mac Pro, it probably didn't take long for Apple to realize they had a trash can fire on their hands, especially with [regard to GPU performance](https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening). When Apple announced eGPU support for macOS in 2017's [High Sierra release](https://web.archive.org/web/20170731114535/https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra-preview/), it was hard not to see the announcement as anything more than an admission that Apple's top-of-the-line desktops and notebooks shipped with subpar GPUs due to their severe thermal constraints. Now, of course Mac had always lagged behind Windows in GPU availability and support, because Apple has never considered AAA gaming to be an important part of the product. But by 2017 (and until the new Mac Pro tower releases this fall), the situation has been especially grim: even for workstation tasks like video encoding and 3D modeling, the internal GPUs Apple has been selling are so bad that they're driving a nontrivial number of creative professionals—a market Apple actually does care about—off its platform.

How else can you explain the absurd amount of effort it must have taken by Apple and Intel to make the following statement true in 2019: instead of putting a beefy graphics card _inside_ your computer, **you are now able to plug in a box housing a best-in-class GPU into your computer and—using a single high-bandwidth cable—push the necessary instructions to render 4K games at 60 frames per second on the card before—over the very same cable—push those frames back to your built-in notebook monitor without introducing any perceptible latency**. That's pretty freakin' cool. 

The idea that you'd be able to connect a GPU over a 1.5 meter cable and get nearly-desktop grade gaming performance still seems far-fetched, even to me, while I literally play games that way. When reasonable people encounter Apple's marketing about eGPUs—which is only focused on creative professional workflows like [_modeling_ VR experiences as opposed to _experiencing_ them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S48T-cOG0ks)—it would be unreasonable to make the logical leap to suppose "ah, yes, surely if I boot the machine into Windows that box would have the necessary drivers and that cable would have the necessary bandwidth to do serious rendering in real-time
